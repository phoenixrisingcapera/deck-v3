  The token was only half the problem. With it fixed the run failed one step

  never checks out. GH_REPO on both gh steps closed it. First green run ever.

# Re-Mint the Deploy-Watch Railway Token

## Why care?

`deploy-watch.yml` exists because a failed Railway deploy is invisible from outside: the
previously-built container keeps serving, the health check keeps passing, and the domain
keeps answering 200. It was written after a broken deploy went unnoticed for twelve days.

It has never succeeded. Every one of the 200 retained runs failed, back to
2026-08-23 — and the secret was last set 2026-08-15, so the watchdog has been blind
since roughly the day it was wired. The watchdog is reproducing the exact failure mode it was
built to end, in a different costume: not silence from a healthy system, but silence from a
sensor nobody is reading.

This is the cheapest item on the board and the one that unblocks confidence in every other
deploy.

## Evidence

Observed on run `34517900649` (2026-09-10 19:01 UTC), byte-identical to runs on 2026-09-08
and to every earlier run in the retained history:

```
Token shape: raw=70 trimmed=63 chars
Token shape: NOT a bare UUID — check for a copied prefix or a truncated paste.
::error::Could not resolve environmentId from the token.
  "message": "Project Token not found"
```

Two facts the workflow's own diagnostics establish:

1. **The value is not a Railway project token.** A project token is a 36-character UUID.
   This is 63 characters after whitespace stripping.
2. **It is not an account token either.** The workflow's fallback retries the same value as
   `Authorization: Bearer` against `query { me { email } }`, and that errors too. So this is
   not a wrong-*kind*-of-token problem — the value itself is invalid.

The 7 stripped whitespace characters (`raw=70` → `trimmed=63`) suggest embedded spaces or
newlines, not a single trailing newline — consistent with a paste that captured surrounding
text.

## The plan

### 1. Mint a fresh project token

Railway dashboard → project `augment-it` → **Settings → Tokens** → create a token scoped to
the **production** environment. Project tokens are dashboard-only; there is no `railway` CLI
or MCP call that mints one.

Least-privilege matters here: an account token would hand this workflow every project in the
workspace. The workflow authenticates with the `Project-Access-Token` header precisely
because it expects a project token.

### 2. Validate before storing

Do not paste blind. Confirm the token resolves an environment first:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2 \
  -H "Project-Access-Token: <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"query { projectToken { environmentId } }"}'
```

Expect `{"data":{"projectToken":{"environmentId":"df7aac8d-543e-47e3-a9e4-482989bbb82f"}}}`.
That UUID is augment-it production — if a different one comes back, the token is scoped to
the wrong environment.

### 3. Store it without trailing whitespace

```bash
printf '%s' '<TOKEN>' | gh secret set RAILWAY_TOKEN --repo lossless-group/augment-it
```

`printf '%s'` rather than `echo` — `echo` appends a newline, and Railway reports a token with
one stray byte as flatly "not found," which is what sent the first diagnosis astray.

### 4. Verify end-to-end

```bash
gh workflow run deploy-watch.yml --repo lossless-group/augment-it
gh run watch --repo lossless-group/augment-it
```

A green run should print `Token shape: matches the UUID form Railway project tokens take.`
followed by a per-service table of latest deployment statuses in the step summary.

## Verification

- [ ] `projectToken { environmentId }` returns `df7aac8d-543e-47e3-a9e4-482989bbb82f`
- [ ] A manually dispatched run completes green
- [ ] The step summary lists all 11 services with `SUCCESS`
- [ ] The next scheduled run is also green (may be hours away — see cron note below)

## Risks and notes

- **The empty-read guard is load-bearing.** The workflow refuses to report healthy on a
  zero-service read, so a token scoped to the wrong project fails loudly rather than
  silently reporting all-clear. Don't remove that guard.
- **Rotation has no reminder.** Nothing currently notices a revoked or expired token except
  this same red run. Worth considering whether the failure should page rather than just
  redden — but that is out of scope here.
- **The cron is not firing at the requested cadence.** The workflow asks for `*/15 * * * *`,
  but observed runs land roughly every 5 hours (01:28, 06:35, 11:50, 15:56, 19:01 UTC on
  2026-09-10). GitHub throttles scheduled workflows heavily, so real detection latency is
  hours, not minutes, even once the token works. Worth a follow-up decision: accept it, or
  move the watchdog to a trigger that actually fires.
- **Do not read the secret back** for verification. Confirm via a green run, not by echoing
  the value.

## Outcome (2026-09-10)

Shipped. Token minted, validated against `projectId a45c72fa…` / `environmentId df7aac8d…`,
and stored via `printf '%s' … | gh secret set`. Run `34540534279` is the workflow's **first
green run in its history**.

### The second bug, which the first was hiding

The token fix alone was not enough. With the Railway query finally passing, the run failed
one step later:

```
failed to run git: fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
```

The job deliberately never runs `actions/checkout` — it doesn't need the code — so `gh` had
no git remote from which to infer a repository, and every `gh issue` call died. That defect
had been latent since the workflow was written and **could not surface while the token was
broken**, because the run always exited before reaching the issue steps.

Fix: `GH_REPO: ${{ github.repository }}` on both `gh`-using steps, rather than `--repo` flags
on each call — one place, covering create/comment/list/close, with no way for them to drift.

### Verified in passing

The green run landed while services were mid-rebuild and reported them as `BUILDING` without
firing. That confirms the transient-state handling works as designed: `BUILDING`, `DEPLOYING`,
`INITIALIZING`, and `QUEUED` are correctly excluded from the failure match.

### Still open

The cron throttling noted under Risks is unaddressed — the workflow requests `*/15` and
GitHub delivers roughly every five hours. Detection latency is hours, not minutes. That
wants its own decision.
