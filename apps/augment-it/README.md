# Augment It

A multi-tenant web app for augmenting tabular data with AI. Upload a CSV or spreadsheet, fire enrichment passes against it (custom LLM prompts or source-bound packs like LinkedIn / X / Bluesky / Wikipedia), triage the responses, accept the good ones back onto rows, promote enhanced rows into new canonical record sets, and continue.

The codebase is a federated set of small Svelte 5 microfrontends mounted into a shell, backed by stateless TypeScript microservices that talk over NATS. Every column on every row is tenant-defined — no hardcoded schema anywhere — so the same tool serves a foundation's grantee pipeline, a VC's deal flow, a recruiter's candidate list, or whatever spreadsheet a user happens to upload.

## Tech stack

### Build & runtime

- **pnpm** workspaces + **Turborepo**
- **Rsbuild 2** with `@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin` 2.x — every app is an independently-served federated remote
- **TypeScript 6** end-to-end
- **Docker Compose** for the backend stack (NATS + services)

### UI

- **Svelte 5** (runes — `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`) — **not React, not Next.js**
- CSS custom properties only — three-mode theme system (`light` / `dark` / `vibrant`) via `packages/theme/theme.css`
- Each remote namespaces its own CSS classes (`.rc-app`, `.pr-app`, etc.) so styles can't leak across federation boundaries

### Backend

- **NATS** as the message bus — every service subscribes to a subject via the `@nats-io/transport-node` v3 client (migrated off the legacy `nats@2` package); the browser talks to the backend via the workspace capabilities router
- **libSQL** / **JSON-stored row + response data** behind small TS services
- **SurrealDB Cloud** as the canonical entity layer — persons, organizations, and domains/sources (the corpus catalog: strategies, theses, topics) live here, shared across every client workspace and resolved via `record-surrealdb-resolver`. This is the "start from data already in the canonical layer" side of the app, alongside the original CSV-first pipeline — see [Core concepts](#core-concepts)
- **didi.sh** as the shared identity plane — magic-link sign-in, org/membership-gated access, actor attribution (`created_by`/`updated_by`) on every canonical write. One account works across this app and its sibling Lossless VC-tooling apps (dididecks, memopop)
- **Anthropic** for free-form prompt enrichment (via `prompt-runner`) and the in-app chat agent ("didi") — same service, two jobs
- **Search providers are pluggable** (via `social-search`): a `connectors/` seam with a common `Connector` interface, dispatched per-fire with an optional `provider_override`, plus a capability-style connector registry (`registry/`) that resolves providers by intent, free-tier first. **SearXNG** (self-hosted, no API key) is the default for the social packs; **Tavily**, **SerpApi**, **GDELT**, **Google News RSS**, and **Exa** (neural search, `EXA_AI_API_KEY`) are registered peers. Response Reviewer's by-record view exposes per-provider re-fires, and the `search-and-add` remote exposes the same registry as a chip palette behind an always-editable search term (additive; never overrides accepted data)

## Core concepts

- **Multi-tenant by default.** Every row's columns are derived per-upload from CSV headers. The code carries no hardcoded knowledge of any specific column name — rendering is type-driven (scalar → text, object/array → JSON), the promote-fold is type-driven (arrays merge, objects merge by key, scalars overwrite), the schema union is presence-driven (any key with a value is a column). See `changelog/2026-05-23_03_All-Data-Continues-Generic-Rendering.md` for the rule and its history.
- **Packs and bundles.** A **pack** is the atomic enrichment unit — one source, one prompt-snippet template, one extraction schema, one render config. A **bundle** is a workflow composition of packs with orchestration, carry-forward between passes, and a single chat verb that fires the whole thing. The contracts are locked in `context-v/blueprints/Packs-and-Bundles-Pattern.md`.
- **Sibling-payload responses.** Every response record carries both prose AND an optional structured `Candidate` (url, display_name, confidence 0–100, snippet, source_metadata), plus an `outcome` enum (`found | not_found | error | skipped | pending`). The renderer in Response Reviewer branches on outcome.
- **Inline correction + human-supply on one surface.** The by-record view in Response Reviewer lets the user edit URLs, edit display_names, edit entity-names (the row's identity column), or supply a URL the pack didn't find — all riding the same `response.set_structured` subject.
- **Federation-host shell, multiple Flows.** The shell used to walk one hardcoded `ROTATION`; it now owns a `FLOWS` registry (`shell/src/flows.svelte.ts`) — each Flow (`Improve a CSV`, `Build Corpora`, `Augment a CSV of Event Attendees`, `Augment a CSV of People`, `Rate Affiliations`, `Augment from DB`, …) is a named use-case with its own rotation, switched via the header's "Flows" popdown. Within a Flow the shell still handles peek-deck tile rotation, co-existence (50/50 splits), and runtime cross-remote communication via `window` events + localStorage. A single-tenant (pinned) deploy defaults to its one relevant Flow rather than the first-registered one.
- **Lenses.** A *lens* is a federated remote that re-presents the active record set under a different affordance shape — sort/filter, inline-edit, per-row corpus add — without leaving the record. `sort-filter-lens` is the first; registered as a third member of `AUGMENT_COMPOSITE` alongside PTM + Pack Runner. Lenses auto-fall-back to the newest non-archived record set when localStorage points at an archived one, so they survive `/promote-snapshot` cleanly.
- **Funder-content corpus.** Per-client, per-funder directory of source materials backing each row. Two entry vectors land into the same shape: the chat `/inbox <url>` verb (with active-client context) and the per-row inline "+ URL" affordance in the lens. Both run fire-and-forget through `services/content-ingest/`, Jina-extract markdown, preserve original PDFs as LFS binaries, and stamp `record_uuid` + `published_at` into frontmatter. Manual-paste URLs land regardless of domain (operator curation trumps the same-host rule, which only binds pack outputs).
- **Corpus chips tell the truth.** `corpus.list_for_record` joins by `corpus_funder_slug` as primary (one dir scan) with `record_uuid` lineage as fallback — chips stay accurate across `/promote-snapshot` cuts. `/promote-snapshot` itself derives `corpus_*` columns from filesystem state when cutting a new record set, and stitches `predecessor_record_set_id` for lineage walks.
- **The canonical layer — a second, DB-first way to build a corpus.** Every flow above starts from an uploaded CSV. `corpora-curator` ("Corpora Curator" in the UI) starts the other direction: pick or create a **domain** — a `type`-discriminated grouping (`strategy`, `thesis`, `topic`, `market-segment`, …) stored in SurrealDB, not the filesystem — and gather **sources** into it (Jina-fetched metadata, full-content fetch, tags, pasted extracts). `record-surrealdb-resolver` owns the DB side (the `domains`/`sources`/`source_usages` tables plus `persons`/`organizations`/`affiliations`); `content-ingest` mirrors every write to an on-disk corpus file. `person-db-resolver`, `record-db-resolver`, and `affiliation-rating-resolver` are the sibling canonical-layer flows — matching/creating people and organizations, then rating the relevance of the affiliation between them — all writing into the same shared entity graph rather than a per-upload CSV schema.
- **Augment from DB — the org-first workbench.** The newest canonical-layer flow inverts the CSV pipeline completely: start from an **organization already in SurrealDB**. `org-workbench` autocompletes to an org (names, aliases, or domains), then shows one card that views AND edits in place — identity/social links, pulse streams (`media_streams`), corpus items, and a reveal of every affiliated person with nested links of their own. Adding a person generates the `affiliations` edge + observation automatically (`person.affiliate`, org pre-bound — no affiliation UI needed, N orgs per person by construction). Every list carries a 🔍 that opens `search-and-add` in a paired tile: the search term stays always-editable, providers swap via the registry palette (SearXNG default, Exa a chip away), and each result row one-click-adds to exactly the list that launched the search. Streams go further — a per-stream **scan** fires the entity-pulse blog machinery at the stream URL and badges anything already in the `content_items` ledger, so "what's new on their blog" is one click and only genuinely-new items get added. Spec: `context-v/specs/Augment-From-DB-Flow.md` (Shipped).
- **Live multi-operator sync.** Domain and source mutations on the canonical layer broadcast over NATS (`domain.created`, `source.added`, …); every connected session in the same workspace refetches automatically. Two people signed into the same client see each other's edits without a refresh.
- **didi.sh identity + actor attribution.** Sign-in is magic-link only (no passwords, invite-only), via the shared `id.didi.sh` service — one account works across this app and its sibling Lossless VC-tooling apps. A signed-in session's `didi_id` rides every capability call and gets stamped as `created_by`/`updated_by` on canonical writes (DB rows and corpus frontmatter alike), so every mutation on the canonical layer carries who did it. The in-app chat agent ("didi") writes through the same envelope, tagged `via: didi-agent`, so an agent-driven edit is distinguishable from a manual one.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Provide API keys via `.env` (see `.env.example`):

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…   # required for prompt-runner
TAVILY_API_KEY=…      # optional — only packs routed to the Tavily connector need it.
                      # Social packs default to SearXNG (self-hosted container, no key),
                      # so pack search works out of the box without this.
```

Pack search runs against a **SearXNG** container that comes up with the stack — no account, no API key. SearXNG isn't an index of its own; it's a metasearch *aggregator* that queries upstream engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave) and merges their results, which is why we get metasearch breadth for free. Override its instance secret with `SEARXNG_SECRET` if you like (a dev default is baked in).

## Get started

Start the full stack (Docker services + every federated remote + shell) with one command:

```bash
pnpm stack up
```

The shell will be available at [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) (`:3000` is deliberately skipped — reserved locally for Open WebUI). Every remote is also independently reachable at its own port (`:3002`–`:3017`, see [App structure](#app-structure) for the full list) — useful for debugging Module-Federation cross-origin errors which the shell's DevTools console scrubs to `'Script error.'`.

Other common commands:

```bash
pnpm dev          # Run just the frontend remotes (no Docker services)
pnpm stack down   # Stop the Docker services
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm preview      # Preview the production build
```

The `scripts/dev.sh` script prints the full URL list on start.

## Testing

Run the whole suite — every package plus the id-didi-sh identity contract — with one command:

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

That runs `scripts/test-all.sh`: each vitest package in turn, the end-to-end backend-chain integration, and (if `mix` is present) id-didi-sh's ExUnit suite in the sibling repo — ending with a grand-total tally (e.g. `✅ ALL SUITES PASSED — 67 tests across 7 suites`).

Of that total, **43 tests across ten groups** are the corpora-builder coverage added in this effort — tracked in human language in [`context-v/specs/Corpora-Builder-Harmony-Test-Registry.md`](context-v/specs/Corpora-Builder-Harmony-Test-Registry.md), where each test's name is the ✓-phrase you see go green. The remainder is id-didi-sh's pre-existing suite, which `mix test` runs alongside this effort's Group A.

Run a single group directly with `pnpm test` in its package:

| Group | Command (`cd` then `pnpm test`) | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| C | `packages/workspace` | client transport resilience (the property test that caught the reconnect bug) |
| B, D, H | `services/workspace` | session tenancy, workspace registry, chat corpora slab |
| E, J | `services/record-surrealdb-resolver` | canonical CRUD + the alignment-audit diff |
| F | `services/content-ingest` | corpus markdown files |
| G | `apps/corpora-curator` | curator surface state (Svelte 5 runes) |
| I | `e2e` | full backend chain over a real WebSocket |

Notes:

- **Nothing touches the shared cloud.** Canonical-layer tests spin a throwaway in-memory SurrealDB; temp dirs stand in for the clients volume. The only thing that reads the real cloud is the read-only **corpora-alignment audit** (`node scripts/audit-corpora-alignment.mjs`) — it flags DB↔disk drift and changes nothing; it's not part of `test:all`'s pass/fail.
- **The E2E group (I)** stands up a disposable backend (throwaway Docker NATS + in-memory SurrealDB + the resolver, workspace-service, and content-ingest) and tears it down after — so it needs **Docker running** and the `surreal` CLI. It uses ports `3199`/`4223`; if an interrupted run leaves anything behind, clear it with `docker rm -f augment-e2e-nats` and `pkill -f "tsx src/server.ts"`.
- **No `ws` package** — the transport tests run against a hand-rolled RFC-6455 server and every client uses the platform-native `WebSocket`.

## Observability

At current scale (single operator) there is **no metrics/tracing platform** —
that would be over-engineering. Log viewing is handled by
[**gonzo**](https://github.com/control-theory/gonzo), a k9s-style real-time
log-analysis TUI (streaming charts, pattern detection, filtering, an optional
OTLP receiver). Install it with:

```bash
brew install gonzo
# or, from the monorepo dev shell: nix run github:control-theory/gonzo
```

Gonzo reads stdin/pipes, files, or OTLP — so point any service log stream at it:

```bash
docker compose logs -f | gonzo          # the whole local backend stack, live
railway logs --service workspace-service | gonzo   # a deployed service
gonzo -f ./some-service.log --follow    # a captured file
```

This is the tooling home for the boot-latency work in
[`context-v/issues/Refactoring-for-API-Speed.md`](context-v/issues/Refactoring-for-API-Speed.md):
watch the cross-service handshake (workspace-service → resolver → content-ingest)
in one pane while the frontend prints its own `performance.now()` boot timings in
the browser console. Gonzo's OTLP receiver (`--otlp-enabled`) is the bridge if we
ever add tracing — but that's deferred until team scale, not one user.

## Deployment

The humain-vc single-tenant instance runs live on **Railway** at
[`https://augment.didi.sh`](https://augment.didi.sh) — 8 services (NATS +
4 backend microservices + 3 federated frontends), two persistent volumes,
and a custom `*.didi.sh` domain (required for the shared `didi_session`
cookie). See **[`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for the full service
list, environment variables, redeploy commands, and the real gotchas hit
getting it there (Railway CLI quirks, Module Federation cross-origin
asset resolution, `nats-server` config).

## Conventions

- **Branch tiers:** `development` → `main` → `master`. Parent on tier X → all submodules on tier X.
- **`context-v/`** is the living documentation tree — specs, prompts, blueprints, reminders, explorations, issues. Every file carries YAML frontmatter with a four-part `semver`; reads as a journey doc with revisions appended over time.
- **`changelog/`** entries get written at the end of any coherent build session — the format follows the Lossless `changelog-conventions` skill (date-prefixed filename, frontmatter with `publish: true`, lede + Why care / What's new / How it works / What's still loose).
- **No hardcoded column names anywhere in the rendering, fold, or schema-union code.** This is load-bearing for multi-tenant correctness.
- **Microfrontends namespace their CSS** (`.rc-app`, `.rr-app`, `.pr-app`, …) so federation can't leak styles.
