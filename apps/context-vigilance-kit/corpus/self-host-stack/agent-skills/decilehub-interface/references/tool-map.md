# Decile Hub MCP — the 158-tool map

Enumerated live from `https://humain.decilehub.com/mcp` on **2026-08-18**
(`tools/list` → 158 tools, `prompts/list` → 0, `resources/list` → 0).
The surface is the same for every tenant; only the data behind it differs.

## Why this file exists

**Decile ships zero tool annotations.** Every one of the 158 tools returns an
empty `annotations` object — there is no `readOnlyHint`, no `destructiveHint`,
no `openWorldHint`. A client has no machine-readable way to tell
`list_people` from `publish_newsletter`. The **Tier** column below is the
missing classification, supplied by us.

| Tier | Count | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 read | 85 | Returns data, mutates nothing | Run freely |
| 🟡 write | 38 | Creates or updates records; additive and recoverable | Say what you're about to write, then write |
| 🟠 confirm | 22 | Deletes, tag removals, batch stage moves, GL postings, entity creation | Name the exact records and get a yes first |
| 🔴 outbound | 13 | Leaves the building — email, network feed, public links, other people's inboxes | Preview first, explicit yes, never batch |

Tiers are **ours**, not Decile's. When Decile adds tools, classify new ones by
asking: *does it leave the building?* (🔴) → *is it hard to undo?* (🟠) →
*does it write?* (🟡) → else 🟢.

Descriptions below are the tools' own first lines, truncated. The tools carry
much longer descriptions in-band — the 🔴 ones in particular spell out their
own preview-first and `confirm: true` requirements. Read the live description
before first use of any tool you haven't run before.

## Re-enumerating after a Decile release

```bash
key=$(grep '^DECILEHUB_API_KEY=' client-stacks/humain-vc/decilehub/.env | cut -d= -f2-)
curl -s -X POST https://humain.decilehub.com/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: $key" \

  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; t=json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["tools"]; print(len(t)); [print(x["name"]) for x in sorted(t, key=lambda y: y["name"])]'
```

Diff the names against this file. New tools get a tier before they get used.
A stale map is worse than none — it classifies a destructive tool as safe.
