description: How The Lossless Group writes and structures changelog/ entries across
  all repos (projects, true monorepos, pseudomonorepos). Use whenever shipping or
  pushing a coherent chunk of work, when scaffolding a new repo's changelog/ directory,
  when authoring a product release message, when the user says "log this", "write
  a changelog", or "ship note", or when reviewing a changelog/ file. Encodes the strict
  frontmatter (publish, lede, ISO dates), filename pattern, "it exists" priority,
  and the show-don't-enforce ethos.

# Changelog Conventions

> **The single most important rule: it exists.** Everything else is refinement.

Every Lossless repo at every level (project, true monorepo, pseudomonorepo) should have a `changelog/` directory at the root, parallel to `context-v/`. Entries are written when meaningful chunks of work ship — or at least when they push.

**Changelog First Development** is a working Lossless theory: a fast-moving, meaningful changelog signals momentum to clients, audiences, contributors, and your own future self. The bus is leaving. The cruise ship is full. See `references/changelog-first-development.md`.

## When to use this skill

- You just shipped or pushed a coherent chunk of work
- The user says "log this", "write a changelog", "ship note", "publish update"
- Scaffolding a new repo's `changelog/` directory
- Reviewing or updating an existing changelog entry
- Authoring a product release message (see `releases/` subfolder below)

## When to write an entry

**Yes:**
- A coherent chunk of work shipped (deployed, merged, released)
- Or at least pushed to a remote where someone else might land on it
- A new convention, blueprint, or tool became available
- Multiple smaller changes have accumulated into something worth announcing

**Not necessarily:**
- Every commit (most aren't worth a changelog)
- Typo fixes, minor refactors, work-in-progress

> **Future direction:** the team is open to a "tweet-style" subset — short, frequent micro-changelogs for the in-between work that doesn't merit a full entry. Not implemented yet; flagged as a candidate.

## Where it lives

```
<any-repo>/
├── context-v/        # living documentation
└── changelog/        # ← this skill governs this directory
    ├── YYYY-MM-DD_NN.md       # entries
    ├── YYYY-MM-DD_NN.md
    └── releases/              # for product-style projects only
        ├── v1.0.0.md
        └── v1.1.0.md
```

- **Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD_NN.md` where `NN` is a daily counter (`01`, `02`, ...). ISO date with dashes — always.
- **`releases/` subfolder:** only for product-style projects with versioned releases. Release messages live there as `<version>.md` (or whatever versioning scheme the product uses). Standard changelog entries live in `changelog/` proper.

## Mandatory frontmatter (last few months and forward)

These six fields are **hardcoded** for new entries — non-negotiable. Older entries may have less or more; respect them.

```yaml
---
date_created: YYYY-MM-DD       # ISO with dashes. Set on creation.
date_modified: YYYY-MM-DD      # ISO. Updated on every edit. Obsidian template often manages this; sometimes meaningless updates happen, that's accepted.
title: "Human-readable title"
lede: "Subtitle that grabs attention — used where the point is to make the reader keep reading"
publish: true                  # Obsidian publisher convention. STRICTLY ENFORCED. Do not deviate.
authors:                       # Humans only. Always a list. Preferred ul format (not [a, b] inline).
  - Firstname Lastname
augmented_with:                # AI tools used. Format: "<tool> on <model name version>".
  - Pi on Claude Sonnet 4.5
files_changed:                 # Optional but strongly recommended. Paths from project root.
  - src/components/NameOfComponent.astro
  - context-v/blueprints/Some-Blueprint.md
---
```

### Notes on the fields

- **`publish: true`** is set by Obsidian publisher and is strictly enforced there. Do not toggle it off without understanding the publishing implications.
- **`lede`** is intentional — not "subtitle" or "description". The word signals: *write something that grabs attention*. The reader should want to keep reading.
- **`authors`** is for **humans only**. Preferred form is the YAML list (one author per line), not inline `[a, b]`. AI agents do not go here, even when they wrote substantial content.
- **`augmented_with`** is for the AI tooling that helped produce the entry. Format is **`<tool> on <model name version>`**, e.g., `Pi on Claude Sonnet 4.5`, `Claude Code on Claude Opus 4`, `Cursor on GPT-5`. Same ul-list preference as `authors`. Include this field whenever an AI agent contributed materially — honesty about augmentation matters more than authorship credit.
- **ISO dates with dashes for everything** — both dates and timestamps. Never `2026/05/04` or `May 4, 2026`.

See `references/frontmatter-spec.md` for edge cases and optional fields.

## Public by default

Changelogs are written **for the public web**. Assume:

- A reader with no prior context lands on this entry from a Google search
- The lede has to do its job in two seconds
- Internal jargon needs a one-sentence translation or a `[[wikilink]]`
- Embarrassments and bugs can be discussed honestly — that's part of building in public

A long-running goal: aggregate all changelogs across all Lossless repos via the GitHub API into a "Lossless Changelog" umbrella view. Write entries that would render well in that aggregated context.

## Marketing up top, engineering notes as the narrative unfolds

**Every `README.md`, every `changelog/` entry, and every `changelog/releases/<version>.md` carries the same discipline: marketing up top, engineering notes as the narrative unfolds.** The opening — lede, Why Care?, What's New? — is marketing-shaped; it has to earn the click and answer "what does this do for me?" The deeper sections — How it Works, Under the Hood, Files Touched — are engineering-shaped; they reward the reader who came for substance with the actual substance. **Both belong in the same document. What differs is sequence.**

The failure mode this rule fights isn't "too engineering" or "too marketing" — it's mixing them in the wrong order. Engineering details in the lede lose the general audience before they get to the value. Marketing language in the Under the Hood section feels evasive to the engineer who scrolled there specifically for the gnarly bits. **Treat the document as a cascade from broad to specific**, and each audience gets dropped at the right station — and trusts what they read on the way down because the voice matches the depth.

The audience cascade isn't "the team plus whoever happens to wander by." It's a deliberate four-tier sequence, and the document is structured so that each tier gets value and is invited to keep reading.

### The four audiences, in the order they appear in the document

| # | Reader | What they want | Where they stop reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **General audience** | *Why should I care? What does this thing do for me?* | After the lede if you don't earn the click; after Why Care? if the framing isn't compelling |
| 2 | **Nerds passing by** | *What's actually new? Does this overlap with something I know?* | After What's New? if nothing piques their interest |
| 3 | **Nerds paying close attention** | *How does it work? What are the gotchas? What did you have to figure out?* | After the deep-dive sections once they've gotten the substance they came for |
| 4 | **Internal team** | *What changed in the codebase? Where do I find X? What's the followup state?* | They read to the end because they have to; this is the tail |

The whole point: **the same document serves all four** by sequencing the content from broadest to most-specific. Lede → Why Care? → What's New? → How it Works → Under the Hood → Files Touched / What's Next / References. **Marketing voice up top dissolves into engineering voice further down** — the lede speaks to anyone, the Files Touched block speaks to the team. Each reader gets dropped at the right station and the prose meets them there.

### The pragmatic argument

"No one will read this" is sometimes literally true. **It's the same amount of effort to draft a release entry someone might want to read as to draft one no one will.** The upside-case (someone lands on it via search, via a sibling-plugin's cross-link, via the org's "Lossless Changelog" rollup, via a tweet) costs nothing extra in effort, and a single positive impression from a stranger is worth more than the same prose buried as internal notes.

This is not about copywriting flair. It's about **sequence**. The lede answers "why care," the H2 sections give increasingly technical readers more depth, and the file-trees and SHA references live at the bottom where the internal team expects them. The doc reads as warm and competent to a general audience and as technically substantive to an engineer because it's both at once, just stacked correctly.

### Long files are fine; stamp a TOC

If a release narrative or a substantial changelog entry runs long, the answer is **not** to trim out the depth — it's to add an **anchor-link table of contents at the top** so each audience tier can jump to their section. Astro's MDX rendering picks up `[Section title](#section-title)` anchors automatically from H2 IDs; for plain Markdown the GitHub renderer handles it the same way. A TOC with 4–6 entries that maps to the audience cascade (`#why-care`, `#whats-new`, `#how-it-works`, `#under-the-hood`, `#whats-next`) is the canonical shape.

### How this composes with the rest of the skill

- The `Body shape` section below codifies the canonical opening sequence (`Why Care?` → `What's New?`)
- The `Tell a story` section frames the structural arc each entry should follow
- The `Voice` section governs the tone in which all four audiences are addressed
- This section above sets the **audience model** the other three sections serve

## Roll-up at every level

The same aggregation principle applies **at every parent → children boundary**, not only at the org-wide top. A pseudomonorepo's splash, site, or gallery should surface its own `changelog/` *and* roll up the changelogs of its submodules into one feed. A reader landing on `content-farm/splash/changelog/` should see ship notes from `image-gin`, `cite-wide`, `perplexed`, and the rest — not just from content-farm itself.

**Mechanism preference:** the **GitHub Content API**, authenticated, at build time. For each submodule, derive the API endpoint from the parent's `.gitmodules` (`url =` → `{owner}/{repo}`, `branch =` → `ref`) and query `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/changelog/`. Merge the results into the parent's collection, sorted by date across the union, with **provenance** rendered on each card (which submodule it came from). Same pattern for `context-v/`.

**Implication for how you write entries:** assume your changelog can be read in three different aggregations — your repo's local list, the parent pseudomonorepo's rolled-up list, and (eventually) the org-wide Lossless Changelog. The lede is your only handhold in the bigger feeds. Make it work without the surrounding repo as context.

For mechanism details — auth, rate-limit handling, failure modes, loader sketch, and provenance metadata — see `pseudomonorepos/references/content-rollup.md`. The composition is intentional: changelog-conventions governs *how to write* an entry; the pseudomonorepos skill governs *how parents aggregate* their children's entries.

**Status:** aspirational. The first two splashes (`memopop-site`, `content-farm/splash`) render local-only changelogs as of writing. Roll-up is the documented next step, not yet implemented in any production splash.

## Show, don't enforce

Conventions here are evolving. People are encouraged to experiment. The way to spread the convention is to **show it working** — not to police existing entries.

- ✅ Write your own entries to the convention
- ✅ Nudge a contributor toward the format when they ask
- ❌ Go around "fixing" old entries to match current frontmatter
- ❌ Reject a PR for using `description` instead of `lede`

The aspiration is consistency. The reality is generative-first. Respect that.

## Reference / submodule projects

**Don't expect them to have proper changelogs or frontmatter.** Many submodules in our pseudomonorepos are external projects we're studying or vendoring. They are out of scope for our conventions. When working *on* an external project's content, follow that project's conventions; when working in *our* code, follow these.

## Body shape: lead with the previewable sections

List views and preview cards on the rendered site use the **first body sections** as previews — just like the lede. Structure entries so the first two sections after the title can stand alone:

1. **`## Why Care?`** — the audience-facing answer. Why does this matter to a reader who isn't on the team? One to three short paragraphs.
2. **`## What's New?`** — the concrete summary. Bullet list or short paragraphs of the actual changes, links to artifacts.
3. **(Then go deeper.)** — the how, the journey, the visuals, the technical details. Readers who care will follow you down. Readers who don't have already gotten the value.

Unless the audience is contributors specifically, **lead with `Why Care?` not with `What's New?`**. The audience cares about impact before inventory.

Both headings are phrased as **questions** — the parallel rhetorical shape ("Why Care? What's New?") signals to the reader that the entry is having a conversation with them, not lecturing them.

## Length: not a factor

Rendering a Markdown file through an SSG costs nothing. **Write what's needed — no more, no less.** Don't pad to look thorough; don't trim to look tight.

The failure modes seen in practice:

- "Make it concise" → too concise, loses the journey
- "Make it robust" → padded with irrelevant minor nonsense

The target: **enough to convince someone to care, plus enough that a reader who cares can follow along and learn something meaningful.**

## Tell a story

A changelog entry is a small journey, not a journal entry and not a list of disconnected fixes.

- ✅ A coherent arc: "We hit X, tried Y, learned Z, here's what shipped"
- ✅ The struggle plus the resolution — readers learn from both
- ❌ Two paragraphs of miscellaneous CSS fixes — not a story
- ❌ A yak-shaving rabbit hole with no resolution — not a story by itself

If you can't articulate the arc, the work probably isn't ready for a changelog entry yet. Combine with related work, or wait.

## Voice

**We are moving fast and learning a ton and we are excited to share this with you. We speak human, we are human. But we are nerdy and we open our nerdy doors.**

In practice:

- First person plural ("we shipped", "we tried") for team work; first person singular when accurate
- Active verbs, present tense for what's now true, past tense for the journey
- Direct address to the reader is welcome
- Jokes that land are welcome; jokes that don't land are skipped
- Show your work — don't hide the messy middle
- Don't use corporate filler ("various improvements", "enhanced experiences")

See `references/voice-and-shape.md` for the full voice/shape guide with examples.

## Use visuals

Visuals make entries skimmable, memorable, and honest about complexity. Use them generously:

- **Code blocks in fences** — with language tags for syntax highlighting
- **Mermaid diagrams** — flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams
- **ASCII diagrams** — for tree structures, simple boxes-and-arrows, rendering everywhere
- **Tables** — when comparing options or showing before/after
- **Screenshots** — for UI work, embedded as relative-path images

The rule: **pretend you need to convince someone to care, and pretend anyone who cares wants to follow along and learn something meaningful.** Show enough of the "how we did this" that it clicks for the reader who reads that far.

## Templates

When creating a new entry, start from `templates/entry.md` (standard changelog) or `templates/release.md` (product release).

## Composition with other skills

- **`pseudomonorepos`** — the `lossless-loop` Phase 2 (Progress) and Phase 4 (Publish) both write to changelogs. Project changelog = Progress. Parent pseudomonorepo changelog = Publish.
- **`context-vigilance`** — changelogs sit alongside `context-v/`, not inside it (aspirationally). Some legacy projects nest them; respect what's there.
- **`astro-knots`** — changelog content gets aggregated and rendered on Astro Knots sites. Write with that publication path in mind.

## Typical flow

1. **You just shipped something.** Pause before opening a new task.
2. **Decide:** is this a coherent chunk worth logging? (Apply the "Yes/Not necessarily" guide above.)
3. **Find the changelog/** at the repo root. Create it if missing.
4. **Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD_NN.md`. Increment `NN` if today already has entries.
5. **Copy** `templates/entry.md`. Fill in frontmatter (all 6 fields, ISO dates, `publish: true`).
6. **Write the lede first.** If you can't write a compelling lede, the work might not warrant an entry.
7. **Body:** what shipped, why it matters, what it enables next. Link related work via `[[wikilinks]]`.
8. **Commit and push.** This entry is part of the work, not separate from it.
