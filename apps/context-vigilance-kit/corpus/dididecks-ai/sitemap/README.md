# Sitemap — Universal Shell Layer

## What this directory is

A **living map** of every artifact in `@dididecks/shell`. One mini-spec per file. Routes go in `routes/`, components in `components/`. Each entry is short on purpose — long enough that an agent (or a human) can answer "what does this thing do, what does it compose, and where did it come from" in under a minute, no longer.

This is the **universal layer**. Every client deck under `client-sites/*` inherits these artifacts unchanged. Per-client overrides and consumer-authored pages/components live in `client-sites/<client>/context-v/sitemap/`.

## Naming-is-fuzzy note — Scroll-UI vs. Play-UI

DidiDecks' proprietary process maintains **two coordinated implementations** of every deck — NOT two views of the same content. They are different components with different constraints, deliberately coupled only by slot identity:

- **Scroll-UI slide** — a **section component** inside one long `/scroll/{deck}/{variant}/index.astro` page. Responsive CSS, vertical reading, JS / animations allowed. The surface Claude (and humans) design **in**, because responsive sections come naturally.
- **Play-UI slide** — a **standalone component file** at `<consumer>/src/components/slides/{variant}/{slot}-{slug}.astro`. Rigid 16:9 at 1920×1080 design size. **No responsive CSS. No JS.** Static HTML/CSS only, so it letterboxes cleanly and PDF-exports without runtime hydration. The surface Claude is **bad at** — rigid-aspect / no-responsive / no-JS is unfamiliar territory.

The workflow this implies: **design in Scroll-UI first, then convert each section into its Play-UI counterpart.** The conversion is non-trivial — "recreate, don't extract" is the discipline encoded in `/api/slide-decompose`. This is Phase 1 → Phase 2 of the deck-iteration-workflow.

Practical consequence for this sitemap: a deck **has** Play-UI only when its per-slide files exist. The presence of a `/scroll/` route does **not** imply `/play/` is renderable. Mini-specs for `routes/play-slot.md` and `components/SlideCanvas.md` reflect this; consumer-side sitemaps under `client-sites/*/context-v/sitemap/` should annotate which slot files exist (status `shipped` vs `stub` vs `planned`).

Several **overlay** components ship in paired variants — most prominently `<DeckOverlay--Scroll-UI>` and `<DeckOverlay--Play-UI>` — because the overlay *surfaces* differ even though both wrap the same conceptual slot. The `--Scroll-UI` / `--Play-UI` suffix is part of the public name; the two variants are sibling files, not props on one file. The slides themselves are not paired in this way — they are unrelated files coordinated only by slot identity.

Glossary:
- **slide** = one slot's worth of content (one section or one standalone file).
- **variant** = an ordered set of slides (e.g. `enhanced-v3`).
- **deck** = a variant as rendered in whichever UI mode the reader is in.

```

The two new categories `runtime/` and `lib/` were added during the 2026-06-06 chroma-to-shell promotion pass that lifted five primitives plus split `mode-switcher` into a runtime concern + `deck-overview` into a lib concern.

## Frontmatter conventions (mini-spec entries)

Every artifact mini-spec uses this shape:

```yaml
---
title: <component or route name + one-line purpose>
lede: <one paragraph that an agent can lift verbatim into a plan>
artifact_kind: route | component | per-slide-component
ownership: shell | consumer
mode: scroll-ui | play-ui | both | n/a
status: shipped | partial | planned | deprecated
shell_version_introduced: 0.1.0-rc.0
composes: [list of other artifacts this one mounts or wraps]
composed_by: [list of artifacts that mount or wrap this one]
theming_tokens_consumed: [--ddd-chrome-bg, --ddd-chrome-fg, ...]
plan_of_record: [[../../plans/Stand-Up-Dididecks-Shell-and-Ship-Chroma-TOC-Ranking]]
file: apps/deck-shell/src/components/DeckChrome.astro
authors: [Michael Staton]
date_last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

The `composes` / `composed_by` fields are the load-bearing ones — together they form the **composition graph** the agent walks when answering "what changes if I touch X."

## How to keep this alive

- When a new artifact is added to the shell, **add its mini-spec in the same commit**. The author of the artifact is the author of its spec.
- When an artifact is renamed, deprecated, or removed, **update the spec same-commit**.
- When composition changes (a component starts mounting another), **update the `composes` / `composed_by` graph**.
- This is *not* a wholesale autogenerated registry. Mini-specs include intent, naming reasoning, and history that source code does not encode. Don't auto-generate; author.

## Per-client sitemap entries

Each `client-sites/<client>/context-v/sitemap/` carries:

- `routes/` — consumer-authored routes (homepage, `/scroll/*`, `/changelog`, etc.)
- `slides/<variant>/<slot>-<slug>.md` — one mini-spec per per-slide component, with frontmatter field `injects_into_shell_slot` that points back at this directory's `routes/play-slot.md`.

When a new client deck is spun up, the new client's sitemap starts empty except for its consumer-authored routes. The shell sitemap is referenced by wikilink, not copied.
