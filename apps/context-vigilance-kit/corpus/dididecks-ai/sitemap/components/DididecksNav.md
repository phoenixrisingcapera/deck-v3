# DididecksNav

## Auto-mount vs. opt-in

- **Auto** on every shell-injected route (`/toc/*`, `/play/*`).
- **Opt-in** on consumer routes — the consumer imports it where its design language fits.

## Brand override

```astro
<DididecksNav>
  <Wordmark slot="brand" />
</DididecksNav>
```

## Status

- ✅ Shipped Phase A+. Active-link state, brand slot, deck-registry-driven links all working.
- ⚠️ Not yet re-tokenized to the `--ddd-chrome-*` namespace (Restore plan), though it's lower-priority than DeckChrome.
- ⚠️ Tier-awareness (showing Design System / Components links at non-private tiers) is Phase B.
