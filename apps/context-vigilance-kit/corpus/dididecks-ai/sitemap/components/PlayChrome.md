# PlayChrome

## Status

⚠️ **Deprecated.** Use `<DeckChrome>` directly. PlayChrome is a thin shim that re-exports DeckChrome with the original v0.1 prop shape preserved.

## Migration path

- New consumers: import `<DeckChrome>` directly
- Existing consumers: continue importing `<PlayChrome>` works; both render the same chrome. Migrate when convenient.
- Slated for removal in v0.3 of the shell

## Why the deprecation

v0.1's heavy dark bottom-bar chrome consumed viewport real-estate continuously and didn't theme cleanly. The calmstorm-flavored floating capsule (DeckChrome) idle-fades, themes via `--ddd-chrome-*` tokens, and exposes a richer two-axis navigation contract (primary slot prev/next + secondary variant cycling). The old PlayChrome had no path to that behavior without a public-API break — DeckChrome is the redo.
