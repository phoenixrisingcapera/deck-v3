lede: Empty-slot fallback on the play route — an invitation to begin the rank → decompose

# DecomposeFirstPlaceholder

## Props

```ts
interface Props {
  deckSlug: string;
  variantSlug: string;
  slot: string;
  slug: string;
  title: string;
}
```

## Tone-of-voice contract

Helpful, instructive — not apologetic and not error-like. Reads to the founder as "the next action is right here," not "something went wrong." Flagged as Open Question #3 in [[../../plans/Phase-A-Plus-In-Deck-Ranking-Shared-Nav-and-Play-Runtime]]; current copy in the component is the initial answer.

## Status

- ✅ Shipped. Links to `/toc/{deck}/{variant}/?focus={slot}` for one-click jump.
- ⚠️ Will render inside `SlideCanvas` (and eventually `ContentFit`) once `/play/[slot]` migrates — placeholder should look like a presentation slot saying "this is empty," not a half-page message.
