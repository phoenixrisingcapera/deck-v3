title: lib/deck-overview — registry + filesystem walker; loadDeckOverview(deckSlug)
  returns DeckOverview with variants/slots/per-slide-file flags
lede: '`loadDeckOverview(deckSlug)` reads registry paths off `globalThis.__dididecksShellOptions`,
  so the shell never needs the consumer''s imports.'

# lib/deck-overview

## Why async

Reads the deck registry via `loadDecksRegistry()` from the shell's `registry-loader`, which uses esbuild to evaluate the consumer's TS registry as a data-URL module. That's an async operation. Calmstorm + chroma's local `deck-overview.ts` was sync because it imported the registry directly via TS imports — the shell version can't do that (it doesn't know the consumer's import paths), so async is structural.

This API drift is the main reason the chroma migration of `lib/deck-overview.ts` is HELD (per [`Lift-Chroma-Decks-Generic-Code-into-Shared-Shell`](../../plans/Lift-Chroma-Decks-Generic-Code-into-Shared-Shell.md) Phase 4 status). Chroma's landing-page callsite still uses chroma's local sync version; humain consumes the shell async version directly.

## What was dropped from the chroma original

Substantiation counts:
- `peopleCount` (from `data/team/*.md`)
- `headshotCount` (from `public/people/*.{jpg,png,...}`)
- `investorFirmCount` (from `data/investors/{firm}/` subdirs)
- `portfolioCompanyCount` (from `data/investors/*/portfolio/*.md`)

These are per-client substantiation layers. The DeckStatsPanel handles the "People" + "Companies" tile counts via its own globs against `/data/**`, so they're surfaced — just not from this lib. Each client that needs richer substantiation counts can wrap this lib + add its own walks.

## SlotPortStatus shape — what `isStaticPort` means

A per-slide file at `src/components/slides/{variant}/{slot}-{slug}.astro` is "static-port" if:
1. It imports `SlideCanvas` (the file content matches `/import\s+SlideCanvas\b/`)
2. It wraps content in `<SlideCanvas ...>` (`/<SlideCanvas[\s>]/`)
3. It has NO `<script>` tag

The third criterion is load-bearing: Play-UI's no-JS contract means a `<script>` tag in a per-slide file disqualifies it from clean static print/export.

## Status

- ✅ Shipped — humain consumes via landing page; chroma still on local sync copy pending API reconciliation
