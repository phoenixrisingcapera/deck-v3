# /toc/[deckSlug]/[variantSlug]/

## Data flow

- `getStaticPaths` enumerates every `(deck, variant)` from the deck registry.
- Render-time reads `SLOTS[variantSlug]` for rows and the audit registry for current ranks.
- Each row's `[view →]` link is conditional on `perSlideFileExists(...)`.

## What needs iteration (founder note 4 from A+ smoke-test)

Unspecified. Founder will supply pointers next session. Likely candidates:
- Re-skin to match `DeckChrome`'s themable namespace.
- Surface decompose-stub state more clearly (icon? row tint? scaffolded-but-empty vs. scaffolded-and-populated?).
- `?focus={slot}` query param wired by `DecomposeFirstPlaceholder` should auto-scroll to that row and highlight it.

## Status

- ✅ Shipped Phase A; A+ added `[view →]` links.
- ⚠️ Cosmetic iteration outstanding.
