# /api/slide-decompose

## Workflow position

This endpoint is the **Phase 1 → Phase 2 bridge** in the deck-iteration-workflow skill:

1. Phase 1 — the scroll-deck variant exists as a single long page.
2. The founder ranks slots in-place (via SlideRankPill) or on the TOC.
3. Click **scaffold** on a slot. This route fires. An empty stub appears at the per-slide path.
4. Phase 2 — the founder recreates the slot's content into the stub at component-library quality. The single-page variant continues rendering unchanged.

The "recreate, don't extract" discipline is encoded in the stub's header comment.

## Safety

- Refuses to overwrite (`409 Conflict` on existing files).
- Validates the slot is in `SLOTS[variantSlug]` before writing.
- Static builds never include this route — file mutations are dev-loop only.
