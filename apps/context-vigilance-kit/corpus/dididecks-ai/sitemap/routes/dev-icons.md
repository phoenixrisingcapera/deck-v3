# /dev/icons

## Current behavior

```
GET /dev/icons   → 200, renders:
                     - "Canonical" section: the chosen icon pair at 16/24/32/48px
                       on light, dark, and brand-tinted backgrounds, with a
                       composed-cell strip showing matrix-cell context
                       (no-drift / drift / pending cases)
                     - "Alternates · design history" section: every unchosen
                       candidate, dimmed, with the same swatches but no
                       composed-cell strip
                     - About-this-route footer explaining the pattern
```

## Why the route is kept

The Phase 4 work could have ended with "founder picks B → delete A and C and the review route." It didn't, by deliberate choice, because the **pattern** generalizes:

- Every future icon family, chip variant, badge style, or button-state set faces the same problem: render candidates in isolation, candidates lie. Render them inside the real composed UI context they'll live in, and the right pick falls out.
- The discipline of "preserve unchosen candidates as design history in `alternates/` directories, importable but not used in production" keeps the decision context legible to anyone reading the codebase cold.
- A single project-local `/dev/*` route that aggregates these reviews is cheaper than a new route per decision and easier for the founder to navigate.

This is project-local discipline today. If the pattern proves useful in a second project (memopop-ai, another dididecks consumer), it graduates to a cross-project skill in `lossless-skills`. See the question deferred from 2026-05-17.

## Related discipline

- **`maintain-design-md` skill** — the sibling pattern for *documenting chosen* design tokens. DESIGN.md is the contract; `/dev/icons` is the workbench where it gets decided.
- **`theme-system` skill** — two-tier tokens + three-mode contract; orthogonal to icon choices but relevant to chip palettes.
- **The `context-v/sitemap/` discipline** — this file is one of those mini-specs. Routes that exist for discipline-reasons (not user-reasons) belong here so they survive future status sweeps without being mistaken for stale.

## Open

- **Pattern promotion to skill.** Deferred 2026-05-17 — revisit when a second consumer or a second design-decision wave validates the pattern.
- **DESIGN.md for dididecks-ai.** Deferred 2026-05-17 — chroma is the only consumer; theming hasn't been stress-tested. Wait for a second client engagement to surface what actually wants to vary before locking the contract.
