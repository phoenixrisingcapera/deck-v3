# Company · Data Model

## What this model represents

A portfolio company — an operating company a VC firm has invested in (or is referenced in the deck as a track-record / exemplar / competitor). One `.md` file per company; sibling-colocated brand assets following the `trademark__{TrainCase}.{ext}` + `favicon__{TrainCase}.{ext}` naming convention.

The CEO of the company is a Person (see [`Person-Data-Model.md`](./Person-Data-Model.md)) — stored either next to the company file (humain pattern: `{co-slug}-ceo.md`) or referenced via a `ceo_slug` field (calmstorm pattern).

## Where it lives in the filesystem

| Client | Path pattern |
|---|---|
| `calmstorm-decks` | `data/firms/{firm-slug}/portfolio/{co-slug}.md` |
| `chroma-decks` | `data/investors/{firm-slug}/portfolio/{co-slug}.md` (one portfolio per backer firm — credibility-card pattern) |
| `humain-vc-decks` | `data/portfolio/{co-slug}.md` (flat operating-company variant — Humain Fund I's own portfolio) |

**Naming convention:** kebab-case slug; `.md` extension.

## Brand assets and discovery globs

The shell discovers companies via .md filenames; assets are discovered by image-extension glob, independent of any registry. Asset filename convention:

| Role | Filename pattern | Aspect | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trademark / wordmark | `trademark__{Company-Name}.{svg\|png\|webp}` | wide / horizontal | Inline header, hero ribbon, wordmark display |
| Favicon | `favicon__{Company-Name}.{svg\|png\|ico\|webp}` | square (1:1) | Tile, list-row chip, app icon |
| og:image | *URL only, not downloaded* | 1.91:1 social card | Portfolio detail-page banner, deck hero |

`{Company-Name}` is **Train-Case** (`Foundation-Health`, `Unnatural-Products`, `9am-Health`), NOT kebab. This is a human-readability convention; the shell's asset glob doesn't care:

```js
// apps/deck-shell/src/routes/data-assets/companies.astro
const assetGlob = import.meta.glob(
  "/data/**/portfolio/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,webp,avif,svg,ico}",
  { eager: true, query: "?url", import: "default" }
);
```

The audit route renders whatever's there — Train-Case, kebab, mismatched, doesn't matter. Don't enforce naming in the DB; enforce by convention.

### Asset strategy metadata (chroma+calmstorm only)

Chroma and calmstorm record *which tier of the fetch cascade succeeded* in frontmatter — useful for the future "re-fetch all rasters as SVG" pass:

```yaml
logo: ./trademark__9am-Health.png
logo_format: png
logo_source: https://...
logo_bg_color_detected: "#000000"
logo_bg_strip_method: imagemagick-floodfill
logo_bg_stripped: true
logo_asset_strategy: og-image-stripped   # ← which tier succeeded
favicon: ./favicon__9am-Health.png
favicon_format: png
favicon_strategy: site-link-icon
og_image_url: https://...
og_image_strategy: og-image
```

Possible `logo_asset_strategy` values observed: `site-svg-path`, `site-raster`, `site-raster-stripped`, `og-image`, `og-image-stripped`, `brandfetch-svg`, `wikimedia-svg`.

**Humain omits all of these** — the humain ingest didn't run the full asset cascade (just grabbed the OG image as WebP from Squarespace). That's a content gap, not a schema gap. The DB column should be nullable.

## Per-client variations (and why)

| Field | Calmstorm | Chroma | Humain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Homepage URL field | `homepage` | `website` (or `homepage`) | `website` |
| Logo field | `logo` (with `./` prefix) | `logo` OR `trademark` | `trademark` |
| Asset strategy metadata | full set | full set | absent (humain ingest skipped) |
| `profiles[]` nested array | yes | no | no |
| `deck_name` + `deck_category` | yes | no | no |
| `review_status` | no | yes (`pending`/...) | no |
| Provenance list | `sources` | `source_urls` | `source_urls` |
| Temporal | `fetched_at` (datetime) | `fetched_at` (datetime) | `ingested_at` (date) |
| Status enum | `complete`/`flagged` | `complete`/`flagged` | `resolved`/`flagged` |
| `humain_relationship` | n/a | n/a | yes (engagement-specific narrative) |

**Why the variation:** same answer as Person — calmstorm was first, chroma rewrote, humain inherited chroma's shape. The `humain_relationship` is engagement-specific narrative (one fund's-eye view); the DB shouldn't try to schematize it strictly — carry as JSON.

## How the shell consumes Company rows

**Route:** `apps/deck-shell/src/routes/data-assets/companies.astro`

**Discovery glob:** `import.meta.glob("/data/**/portfolio/*.md", { eager: true, query: "?raw", import: "default" })`

**Filter applied:** rows where `frontmatter.role_class` is NOT set. (Persons — see `Person-Data-Model.md` — also live under `portfolio/`, distinguished by the *presence* of `role_class`.)

**Fields the route reads:**

```
name · slug · homepage / website · firm_slug
sector · description / description_short
logo / trademark · favicon · og_image_url
asset_strategy fields (logo_asset_strategy, favicon_strategy, …)
confidence · status · ingested_at / fetched_at
ceo_slug (if present)
```

The audit route also pairs each company row with its colocated brand-asset files via the parallel asset glob.

## What's load-bearing

- **`slug`** — primary key; filename stem; URL fragment
- **Absence of `role_class`** — discriminator from Person on the same `portfolio/` glob
- **`trademark` + `favicon` filenames + colocated files** — without these the audit row shows dashes for assets
- **`firm_slug`** — required for chroma's multi-investor pattern (so the audit page can group by firm); nullable for humain's flat pattern

### Asset-strategy enum (free-form text, but document the known values)

```
site-svg-inline     — extracted from <svg> inside the company's homepage HTML
site-svg-path       — found at /logo.svg or similar common path
site-raster         — PNG/JPG from /logo.png or similar
site-raster-stripped — same as above, with background flood-filled to transparency
og-image            — derived from <meta property="og:image"> on homepage
og-image-stripped   — og:image with bg strip
brandfetch-svg      — pulled from Brandfetch API (tier 4 of the cascade)
wikimedia-svg       — pulled from Wikimedia / SVG-repo search (tier 5)
google-svg          — Google Custom Search with fileType=svg (tier 6, last resort)
```

The full cascade is documented in `context-v/agent-skills/crawl-fetch-ingest/SKILL.md` § "Trademark / wordmark cascade".

## Open questions for the collaborator

1. **Brand-asset binary storage:** like Person headshots, do brand assets get an S3/CDN URL only, or also bytes-in-DB? Recommendation: URL only.

2. **`firm_slug` as nullable FK:** humain's `data/portfolio/` rows have no `firm_slug`. Should the DB enforce non-null + auto-populate with the engagement's own firm? Recommendation: leave nullable; humain's operating-company variant is a real shape that shouldn't be forced into firm-anchored.

3. **Engagement-specific narrative as JSON:** humain has `humain_relationship`, `deal_validation[]`, `aggregate_deal_value`, etc. — fields the next client may name differently (e.g., `chroma_position`, `co_invest_partners[]`). Recommendation: keep these as a Json column `engagement_narrative`; columnize only if a query layer needs to filter by them across engagements.

4. **De-dup across engagements:** if Calmstorm and Humain both invest in Company X, two rows or one? Recommendation: two rows, with a `canonical_company_id` FK that links if/when curated. Same answer as Person.

5. **Asset-strategy enum strictness:** new tiers may emerge. Recommendation: free-form text in DB; enum lives in the skill spec.
