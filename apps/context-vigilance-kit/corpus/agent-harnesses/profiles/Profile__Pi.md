# Pi — Profile

A profile of Pi as it lives in this study (`studies/agent-harnesses/pi/`). Cites pinned paths so you can jump to source rather than trust paraphrase. Read alongside `Profile__Opencode.md` (same study, same five deep-dive questions) and the sibling harnesses `goose` (Rust, extensions-as-MCP-wrapper) and `aider` (git-native repo-map/diff-based, no MCP) — Pi is the study's "deliberately minimal core, capability-as-extension" corner, and its own README explicitly stakes out that ground.

## TL;DR

Pi's own docs are unusually blunt about what it refuses to be. `packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md:307` states the core design boundary in one line: **"It intentionally does not include built-in MCP, sub-agents, permission popups, plan mode, to-dos, or background bash."** The README doubles down with a direct rebuttal to the industry-standard MCP pattern (`packages/coding-agent/README.md:493`): **"No MCP. Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support."** — linking out to the maintainer's own blog post arguing MCP is unnecessary overhead for a CLI-native agent. `CONTRIBUTING.md:7-11` gives the philosophy driving both refusals: *"pi's core is minimal... If your feature does not belong in the core, it should be an extension."*

The monorepo shape is a real, five-package npm workspace, verified via each package's own `package.json`, not the four-package guess a prior pass assumed: `packages/ai` → `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (provider abstraction — 38 distinct provider integrations, see Deep dive 1's provider-abstraction note below), `packages/tui` → `@earendil-works/pi-tui` (terminal rendering), `packages/agent` → `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core` (session/harness engine, depends on `pi-ai`), `packages/coding-agent` → `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (the actual CLI, depends on all three), and a fifth, `packages/orchestrator` → `@earendil-works/pi-orchestrator`, explicitly labeled `"experimental orchestrator package for pi"` in its own `package.json:4`. All five sit at version `0.80.6`. The package manager is **npm**, not pnpm or Bun — confirmed by a root `package-lock.json` (`"lockfileVersion": 3`) and the total absence of `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `bun.lockb` anywhere in the checkout, a real divergence from OpenCode's Bun-only stance.

Despite the "no MCP, no sub-agents" party line, both features exist in this checkout in a specific, deliberate way: not vendored in core, but shipped as real, maintained example extensions and mentioned nowhere as vendored core packages. This is the single most important nuance a shallow read of the README would miss, and it's covered in full in Deep dives 4 and 5 below.

Session persistence is the loudest counter-example to "minimal": Pi ships a genuine git-like, tree-structured, branchable session format — `/tree`, `/fork`, `/clone` are real, shipped, iterated-on commands, not aspirational docs (`packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md:3730-3736`, v0.31.0: *"This release introduces session trees for in-place branching... navigate to any previous point with `/tree`, continue from there, and switch between branches while preserving all history in a single file."*). **Pi's mental model is: keep the agent loop and tool surface deliberately small and auditable, but make the session itself a serious, append-only, branchable, git-adjacent data structure — and push MCP, sub-agents, and anything else "big" out to an extension SDK the project dogfoods on itself via its own `.pi/` directory.**

The project's own `packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` is 4,947 lines, structured in Keep-a-Changelog form (`## [Unreleased]` at the top, with `### Breaking Changes` / `### New Features` / `### Added` subsections, e.g. lines 1-14) — this is not a token gesture at release notes but an actively maintained ship-log spanning hundreds of point releases (`git describe --tags` on this pinned commit resolves to `v0.80.6-24-g0e6909f0`, i.e. 24 commits past the `v0.80.6` tag), which is itself evidence that the "session trees" and "renamed `/branch` to `/fork`" claims cited above are real historical events, not retrofitted documentation.

## Why this exists

Pi frames itself, in its own philosophy documents, as a reaction against feature-creep in coding-agent harnesses. `packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md:307-309` lists what's deliberately absent — MCP, sub-agents, permission popups, plan mode, to-dos, background bash — and for each, points at an escape hatch: build it as an extension, spawn separate `pi` processes via tmux, or install a package that does it your way. `SECURITY.md:37-56` extends the same posture to its threat model: there is no built-in permission system, and "prompt injection," "malicious trusted extension/skill," and "AGENTS.md prompt injection" are explicitly named as **out of scope** for security reports — containment is pushed to external sandboxing (a Gondolin micro-VM example extension, plain Docker, or OpenShell, per `README.md:37-46`), not solved in-process. `CONTRIBUTING.md:7-11`'s "core minimal, capability as extension" line is the load-bearing sentence for every design decision downstream of it. `AGENTS.md` (repo root, 163 lines) is the flip side — a genuinely detailed operating manual the maintainers hold their own contributing agents to, forbidding destructive git operations for concurrent-session safety (`AGENTS.md:57-59`) and mandating `npm run check` after any change (`AGENTS.md:28`).

## Deep dive 1 — file/session organization: `~/.pi/agent/`, no XDG, project-local `.pi/` gated on trust

Pi does **not** use the XDG Base Directory spec. A targeted search across `packages/*/src` for `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME`/any `XDG_*` variable found exactly one hit, and it's unrelated to config paths: `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/clipboard-image.ts:23` checks `env.XDG_SESSION_TYPE === "wayland"` purely to detect a Wayland compositor for clipboard-image handling. Every config/session path instead hangs off a single global root, resolved in `packages/coding-agent/src/config.ts:514-521`:

```ts
export function getAgentDir(): string {
	const envDir = process.env[ENV_AGENT_DIR];
	if (envDir) return expandTildePath(envDir);
	return join(homedir(), CONFIG_DIR_NAME, "agent");
}
```

`CONFIG_DIR_NAME` defaults to `.pi` but is actually read from the CLI package's own manifest — `packages/coding-agent/package.json:6-8` declares `"piConfig": {"configDir": ".pi"}` — and `ENV_AGENT_DIR` is computed as `${APP_NAME.toUpperCase()}_CODING_AGENT_DIR` (`config.ts:495`), i.e. `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` by default, or a different prefix entirely for a white-labeled binary. So the canonical global root is `~/.pi/agent/`, and everything else is derived from it: `getModelsPath()`, `getAuthPath()`, `getSettingsPath()`, `getToolsDir()`, `getBinDir()` (managed `fd`/`rg` binaries), `getPromptsDir()`, `getCustomThemesDir()`, `getSessionsDir()` (`config.ts:523-559`).

Session files live at a formulaic path documented directly in `packages/coding-agent/docs/session-format.md:7-11`: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<cwd-with-slashes-as-dashes>--/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`, implemented in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` via `resolvedCwd.replace(/^[/\\]/, "").replace(/[/\\:]/g, "-")`. Each session is one JSONL file — one JSON object per line — versioned (current version 3, enforced at `packages/agent/src/harness/session/jsonl-storage.ts:70`: `if (header.version !== 3) throw invalidSession(...)`), with a header shape of `{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"uuid","timestamp":"ISO8601","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"optional-path"}` (`session-format.md:190-198`, matching the `SessionHeader` interface at `jsonl-storage.ts:8-16`). `getDebugLogPath()` (`config.ts:563-566`) puts a per-app debug log alongside the agent dir as `${APP_NAME}-debug.log` — the same white-labeling mechanism (`APP_NAME` from `piConfig.name`, `config.ts:489-490`) that lets a distributor rebrand `.pi` and `pi-` prefixes wholesale without touching source.

The three env vars that actually govern this layout are documented verbatim in `packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md:294-300`: `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` ("Override config directory; default is `~/.pi/agent`"), `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` ("Override session storage directory; overridden by `--session-dir`"), and `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` ("Override package directory, useful for Nix/Guix store paths" — a concrete acknowledgment that Pi expects to run from read-only Nix-store installs, not just a mutable `node_modules`). Two more, `PI_OFFLINE` and `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` (`usage.md:297-298`), gate every network call the CLI makes at startup — including the `pi.dev` latest-version check — behind explicit opt-outs, a detail that matters for anyone running Pi in an air-gapped or CI environment.

### Settings precedence: global vs. project, lock-protected, deep-merged

`packages/coding-agent/src/core/settings-manager.ts` makes the global/project precedence concrete rather than aspirational. `FileSettingsStorage`'s constructor (`settings-manager.ts:187-196`) resolves exactly two files — `join(resolvedAgentDir, "settings.json")` (global, i.e. `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`) and `join(resolvedCwd, CONFIG_DIR_NAME, "settings.json")` (project, i.e. `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json`) — and every write goes through `withLock(scope, fn)` (`settings-manager.ts:224-225`), which acquires a real file lock via the `proper-lockfile` package with a synchronous retry loop (`acquireLockSyncWithRetry`, lines 199-221, up to 10 attempts at 20ms) before mutating either file — a concrete safeguard against two concurrent Pi processes corrupting `settings.json`. The merge itself is `deepMergeSettings(base, overrides)` (`settings-manager.ts:131-155`): nested objects merge key-by-key recursively, but primitives and arrays are replaced wholesale by the override — documented in the function's own comment as *"project/overrides take precedence, nested objects merge recursively."*

### Provider abstraction: 38 integrations behind one interface, browser-safe by construction

`packages/ai` is not a thin Anthropic-plus-OpenAI wrapper — `packages/ai/src/providers/` contains 38 distinct non-`.models.ts` provider modules (verified via `find … -type f -name "*.ts" ! -name "*.models.ts" ! -name "all.ts" | wc -l`), covering the obvious majors (`anthropic.ts`, `openai.ts`, `google.ts`, `google-vertex.ts`, `amazon-bedrock.ts`, `mistral.ts`, `azure-openai-responses.ts`) alongside a long tail of gateways and regional variants (`openrouter.ts`, `together.ts`, `fireworks.ts`, `groq.ts`, `cerebras.ts`, `cloudflare-workers-ai.ts`, `cloudflare-ai-gateway.ts`, `vercel-ai-gateway.ts`, `github-copilot.ts`, `huggingface.ts`, `nvidia.ts`, `deepseek.ts`, `moonshotai.ts` + `moonshotai-cn.ts`, `minimax.ts` + `minimax-cn.ts`, `zai.ts` + `zai-coding-cn.ts`, `xiaomi.ts` plus three region-specific `xiaomi-token-plan-{ams,cn,sgp}.ts` variants, `kimi-coding.ts`, `ant-ling.ts`, `xai.ts`, `opencode.ts` + `opencode-go.ts`). All 38 are imported and composed in one aggregator, `packages/ai/src/providers/all.ts:5-30`, each exporting a `*Provider` object consumed by `createModels()` (`all.ts:3`).

A small but telling detail: `packages/ai/src/env-api-keys.ts:1-23` deliberately avoids top-level `node:fs`/`node:os`/`node:path` imports — the file comment reads *"NEVER convert to top-level imports - breaks browser/Vite builds"* (`env-api-keys.ts:1`) — and instead dynamically `import()`s them only `if (typeof process !== "undefined" && (process.versions?.node || process.versions?.bun))` (lines 13-23). This confirms `pi-ai` is engineered to run inside a browser bundle as well as Node/Bun, with Node-only environment-variable API-key lookup silently no-op'ing outside those runtimes. Auth material itself resolves through `getAuthPath()` (`packages/coding-agent/src/config.ts:534-536`), joining the same global agent dir to `auth.json` — one file, alongside `settings.json` and `models.json`, all siblings under `~/.pi/agent/`.

### Managed `fd`/`rg` binaries

`getBinDir()`'s own doc comment (`config.ts:547-550`) is explicit: *"Get path to managed binaries directory (fd, rg)"*, resolving to `~/.pi/agent/bin`. `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/tools-manager.ts` backs this with a real downloader: a `TOOLS` registry (lines 29-53+) maps `fd` → GitHub repo `sharkdp/fd` and `rg` → `BurntSushi/ripgrep`, each with a `getAssetName(version, platform, arch)` function that picks the right release tarball per OS/arch, a `systemBinaryNames` fallback list (e.g. `["fd", "fdfind"]`) to prefer an already-installed system binary before downloading, and an offline guard — `isOfflineModeEnabled()` (lines 14-17) checks `PI_OFFLINE` before attempting any network fetch, with `NETWORK_TIMEOUT_MS = 10_000` and `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS = 120_000` as hard ceilings (lines 10-11). This is a real, working binary-management layer, not a shell-out-and-hope wrapper.

Project-local resources live under `<cwd>/.pi/` but are **gated on project trust**, not loaded unconditionally the way OpenCode's directory walk-up is. `resource-loader.ts:966-967` reads `join(this.cwd, CONFIG_DIR_NAME, "SYSTEM.md")` only `if (this.settingsManager.isProjectTrusted() && existsSync(projectPath))`; the same gate applies to `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (lines 979-991). The bootstrap sequence is deliberately two-pass: `loadProjectTrustExtensions()` first force-disables project trust (`resource-loader.ts:330-336`, `this.settingsManager.setProjectTrusted(false)`) to load only global/user + CLI-temporary resources, and only after a `resolveProjectTrust` callback decides to trust the project does the real `reload()` proceed (lines 338-350) — a real, code-level defense against an untrusted repo's `.pi/` silently executing extension code on first open. AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md discovery, by contrast, is unconditional and walks upward from cwd to filesystem root (`resource-loader.ts:85-120`), globally first, then root-to-cwd ancestor order.

## Deep dive 2 — memory/state persistence: session trees, and `/tree`/`/fork`/`/clone` are real, not aspirational

This is the headline finding: **session rewind/branching is real, shipped, and iterated on across multiple releases** — not a docs-only claim. The core primitive is `packages/agent/src/harness/session/session.ts` (338 lines): every append (`appendMessage`, `appendThinkingLevelChange`, `appendModelChange`, `appendCompaction`, `appendCustomEntry`, `appendLabel`, `appendSessionName`) constructs a tree node whose `parentId` is `await this.storage.getLeafId()` (e.g. `session.ts:203-211`). The literal "rewind" operation is `moveTo(entryId, summary?)` (`session.ts:318-337`): it calls `this.storage.setLeafId(entryId)`, moving the active tree pointer to any prior entry, and optionally appends a `branch_summary` entry recording where the abandoned branch was left — invoked from `packages/agent/src/harness/agent-harness.ts:804` during `/tree` navigation, with an LLM-generated summary via `generateBranchSummary` (`agent-harness.ts:763`).

Crucially, branching is **additive, never destructive**: `packages/agent/src/harness/session/jsonl-storage.ts:247-265`, `JsonlSessionStorage.setLeafId()`, appends a `LeafEntry` (`{type:"leaf", id, parentId, targetId}`) to the same JSONL file rather than truncating or rewriting it; `getPathToRoot(leafId)` (lines 296-309) walks `parentId` links backward to reconstruct whichever branch is currently active. Three user-facing slash commands expose this, registered at `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts:31-33`: `/fork` ("Create a new fork from a previous user message"), `/clone` ("Duplicate the current session at the current position"), `/tree` ("Navigate session tree (switch branches)"). Double-Escape on an empty editor triggers tree/fork navigation per a configurable `doubleEscapeAction` (`packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts:2540-2559`).

This is not retrofitted marketing copy — the CHANGELOG shows real naming churn typical of an evolving feature: `CHANGELOG.md:3730-3736` (v0.31.0) announces session trees directly: *"Sessions now use a tree structure with `id`/`parentId` fields. This enables in-place branching."* `CHANGELOG.md:3080` records that the command was originally called `/branch` and was later renamed to `/fork` (issue #641); `CHANGELOG.md:1171` documents `/clone` being added afterward specifically so `/fork` could narrow its meaning to "fork from a prior user message." `packages/coding-agent/docs/sessions.md:69-139` gives a full ASCII-art worked example and a `/tree` vs `/fork` vs `/clone` comparison table.

## Deep dive 3 — tool-call tracing: a real typed hook/event system, but no OTLP or distributed tracing

There is **no OpenTelemetry SDK usage anywhere in Pi's own source.** `@opentelemetry/api@1.9.0` appears only as a dependency in `packages/ai/package.json:59`, almost certainly a transitive requirement of `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`; a direct grep for `opentelemetry` across `packages/ai/src/**/*.ts` returned zero matches — it is never imported or instrumented against. What the codebase itself labels "telemetry" is narrower still: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/telemetry.ts:8-12` defines `isInstallTelemetryEnabled()`, gated by env var `PI_TELEMETRY` — this is an anonymous install/update ping, not tool-call tracing (`packages/coding-agent/docs/usage.md`'s env-var table confirms: *"Override install/update telemetry and provider attribution headers"*).

What does exist, and is real: a plain in-process `EventEmitter` (`packages/coding-agent/src/core/event-bus.ts:1-33`, `createEventBus()` wraps Node's `node:events`, with per-handler error-swallowing at lines 19-25), plus a genuinely typed, per-tool hook API for extension authors in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/types.ts`. The `ToolCallEvent` union, read verbatim (`extensions/types.ts:890-898`):

```ts
export type ToolCallEvent =
	| BashToolCallEvent
	| ReadToolCallEvent
	| EditToolCallEvent
	| WriteToolCallEvent
	| GrepToolCallEvent
	| FindToolCallEvent
	| LsToolCallEvent
	| CustomToolCallEvent;
```

fires *before* a tool executes and can block/mutate its input; a mirrored `ToolResultEvent` union (lines 949-957) fires after, with per-tool `details` typed (e.g. a `BashToolDetails` shape carrying exit code/stdout/stderr). This is exactly the mechanism the project's own dogfooded extension `.pi/extensions/tps.ts:13,17` uses — hooking `agent_start`/`agent_end` to compute and display tokens-per-second and cache-read/cache-write token counts after each turn. It is a real, well-typed local hook system an extension could wire into an external exporter, but Pi core ships no tracer, no span format, and no OTLP integration itself. Session-analysis scripts (`scripts/cost.ts`, `scripts/tool-stats.ts`, `scripts/stats.ts`) exist too, but they post-process JSONL session files after the fact — not live telemetry.

## Deep dive 4 — tool/MCP scoping: MCP is referenced-only, and deliberately absent by design

MCP is **not vendored anywhere in this checkout.** `find . -iname "*mcp*"` (excluding `node_modules`) returns zero directory or file matches — there is no `packages/pi-mcp-adapter`, no `packages/mcp`, no client or server implementation. A whole-repo case-insensitive grep for "mcp" turns up exactly four non-implementation hits: (1) `packages/coding-agent/README.md:388`, MCP listed as an example of what an extension *could* add; (2) the explicit refusal at `README.md:493`, quoted in the TL;DR, with a link to the maintainer's blog post arguing against needing MCP; (3) `packages/coding-agent/test/settings-manager-bug.test.ts:45,52-53`, where the literal string `"npm:pi-mcp-adapter"` appears purely as an arbitrary fixture value in a `SettingsManager` unit test about preserving user edits to `settings.json` — the test exercises no MCP logic and the string is interchangeable with any package name; (4) an unrelated OAuth scope string `"user:mcp_servers"` in `packages/ai/src/utils/oauth/anthropic.ts:38`, which is Anthropic's own Console OAuth scope, not Pi's. **Verdict: referenced-only, and explicitly, deliberately absent by design** — not a package that exists but wasn't checked out; it simply isn't implemented here, by philosophy.

Tools themselves are registered through a straightforward built-in + extension model rather than an MCP-mediated one. There is no single central "tool registry array" the way OpenCode's `ToolRegistry.Service` composes one — instead, each built-in tool lives in its own file under `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/` (`bash.ts`, `read.ts`, `edit.ts`, `write.ts`, `grep.ts`, `find.ts`, `ls.ts`), each exporting a `create<Name>Tool()`/`create<Name>ToolDefinition()` factory pair, and all barrel-re-exported through `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/index.ts:1-60` (confirmed by direct read: the file is a flat sequence of `export { create*Tool, create*ToolDefinition, type *ToolInput, ... } from "./*.ts"` blocks, one per tool). `packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts:90` shows the actual default selection at the point tools are assembled into a turn: `const tools = selectedTools || ["read", "bash", "edit", "write"]` — a plain string-array default, not a schema-driven permission object. Extensions add to this surface via `registerTool(...)`, the same API the example `subagent` extension uses (see Deep dive 5), exposed through the typed hook infrastructure in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/loader.ts` and `extensions/types.ts`.

There is no wildcard-permission-rule engine analogous to OpenCode's `Permission.evaluate` — `SECURITY.md:37-56` states plainly that Pi has no built-in permission system at all; scoping/sandboxing is pushed entirely to the process/OS boundary (tmux panes, Docker, the Gondolin micro-VM example extension) rather than an in-process ruleset.

## Deep dive 5 — skills/subagents/custom-commands: `.md`-file loaders, and subagents as a real example extension (not core)

**AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md loading**: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/resource-loader.ts:67-83`, `loadContextFileFromDir(dir)`, checks candidates in order `["AGENTS.md", "AGENTS.MD", "CLAUDE.md", "CLAUDE.MD"]` — both conventions are recognized, first match per directory wins. `loadProjectContextFiles()` (lines 85-120) loads the global agent-dir's context file first, then walks upward from cwd to filesystem root collecting one per ancestor, ordered global-first then root-to-cwd. A `--no-context-files`/`-nc` CLI flag disables this entirely (`packages/coding-agent/src/cli/args.ts:270`). Separately, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/read.ts:37` gives `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` special compaction/truncation treatment when read via the `read` tool.

**Prompt templates / slash commands**: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/prompt-templates.ts` implements a `.md`-file-as-slash-command system — `loadTemplateFromFile()` (lines 103-132) derives the command name from the filename and reads `description`/`argument-hint` frontmatter; `substituteArgs()` (lines 69-101) supports bash-style `$1`/`$@`/`$ARGUMENTS`/`${N:-default}`/`${@:N}` substitution. `loadPromptTemplates()` (lines 193-262) loads from `agentDir/prompts/` (global) and `cwd/.pi/prompts/` (project-local) plus any CLI-supplied paths. This checkout's own `.pi/prompts/{cl,is,pr,sa,wr}.md` are real, working examples the maintainers use on themselves — e.g. `.pi/prompts/wr.md` ("Wrap it") sequences changelog-update, PR-comment, commit, push, and issue-close, gated on the branch being `main`.

The `/share` slash command (registered in `slash-commands.ts`, described as *"Share session as a secret GitHub gist"*) is implemented at `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts:5513-5522`: it spawns `gh gist create --public=false <tmpFile>` (line 5522) as a real child process, streams its stdout/stderr, and parses the returned `https://gist.github.com/<user>/<id>` URL to extract the gist ID (lines 5544-5548) — this is the mechanism the `.pi/extensions/import-repro.ts` dogfooded extension (Deep dive 3 above) consumes on the receiving end, closing the loop between "one maintainer shares a repro session" and "another maintainer's Pi imports and replays it locally."

**Skills**: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/skills.ts` (487 lines) is a parallel `.md`-file loader — respects `.gitignore`/`.ignore`/`.fdignore` while scanning (`IGNORE_FILE_NAMES`, line 15), enforces `MAX_NAME_LENGTH = 64`/`MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH = 1024` (lines 11, 14), and supports a `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter flag. This checkout's own `.pi/skills/add-llm-provider.md` is a real dogfooded example: a 7-step checklist for adding a new LLM provider (core types → provider implementation → lazy registration → model generation → tests → coding-agent wiring → docs), citing `packages/ai/src/types.ts` for step 1 and, at step 3 (`add-llm-provider.md:31`), *"Register the provider in `packages/ai/src/providers/register-builtins.ts` via lazy loader wrappers."* Worth flagging precisely rather than repeating uncritically: the only `register-builtins.ts` that actually exists in this checkout is `packages/ai/src/providers/images/register-builtins.ts` (image-model registration) — the skill file's own path for the general-provider registrar is slightly stale relative to this pinned commit, a small real-world instance of the exact kind of doc/code drift this profile is trying to avoid.

The full built-in slash-command roster, read directly from `packages/coding-agent/src/core/slash-commands.ts:24-45` (`BUILTIN_SLASH_COMMANDS`, 22 entries), spans session/model management (`/settings`, `/model`, `/scoped-models` — "Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling"), the branching trio (`/fork`, `/clone`, `/tree`), export/import/sharing (`/export` — "HTML default, or specify path: .html/.jsonl", `/import`, `/share`, `/copy`), trust and auth (`/trust` — "Save project trust decision for future sessions", `/login`, `/logout`), and lifecycle (`/new`, `/compact`, `/resume`, `/reload` — "Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and context files", `/quit`). That `/reload` entry is itself a small confirming data point for this profile's config-discovery claims above: it explicitly re-runs discovery for all five resource types plus context files, meaning none of them are cached for the life of the process — they're designed to be hot-reloadable mid-session.

**Subagents**: core explicitly excludes them (`docs/usage.md:307,309`: *"No sub-agents... Spawn pi instances via tmux, or build your own with extensions"*) — grep across `packages/*/src` for a built-in `registerTool("subagent", ...)` finds none. But a complete, real, maintained implementation ships as a first-party **example extension**: `packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/index.ts` registers a tool literally named `"subagent"` (line 462, description at line 465: *"Delegate tasks to specialized subagents with isolated context."*), spawning a **separate `pi` process per invocation** (doc comment, lines 2-12) into an isolated scratch dir (`fs.promises.mkdtemp(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "pi-subagent-"))`, line 240), with named personas at `subagent/agents/{planner,reviewer,scout,worker}.md` and orchestration prompts at `subagent/prompts/{implement,implement-and-review,scout-and-plan}.md`. It has real iteration history in the CHANGELOG (parallel-mode diagnostics, Bun-vfs path-leak fixes, agent-dir resolution fixes — `CHANGELOG.md:681,1347,2128,2268,3636,4293-4309`) and is cross-listed in `packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md:2872`. The repo's own analysis tooling independently reuses the same spawn-a-`pi`-process pattern (`scripts/session-transcripts.ts:78`, `runSubagent()`). **Verdict: core has zero built-in subagent tool, but a complete, first-party, maintained example extension implements the concept fully** — precisely the "core minimal, capability as extension" philosophy in action.

### Non-interactive/scripting mode and the TUI package

Pi is not TUI-only. `packages/coding-agent/src/cli/args.ts:140-145` implements a real `--print`/`-p` flag: *"Non-interactive mode: process prompt and exit"* (help text at `args.ts:244`), which greedily consumes the next positional argument as the prompt message unless it looks like a flag or an `@`-file reference (`args.ts:141-144`). Paired with it is a genuine output-mode selector — `export type Mode = "text" | "json" | "rpc"` (`args.ts:10`), surfaced as `--mode <mode>` ("text (default), json, or rpc", `args.ts:243`) — the `"rpc"` mode is the concrete mechanism for driving Pi as a subprocess from another program (exactly the pattern the example `subagent` extension and the maintainers' own `scripts/session-transcripts.ts` both use to spawn and control child `pi` processes). The README's own usage example at `args.ts:296` (`${APP_NAME} "Read package.json" "What dependencies do we have?"`) shows the same flag family used for a one-shot, scriptable invocation.

`packages/tui/src/` is a from-scratch terminal-UI toolkit, not a wrapper around an existing TUI framework: `tui.ts` (the core render loop), `keys.ts`/`keybindings.ts`/`native-modifiers.ts` (input handling), `editor-component.ts` (the multi-line prompt editor), `autocomplete.ts` and `fuzzy.ts` (completion), `undo-stack.ts`/`kill-ring.ts` (Emacs-style text-editing primitives), `word-navigation.ts`, `terminal-image.ts`/`terminal-colors.ts` (image/color rendering), and `stdin-buffer.ts` (raw input capture) — all confirmed present via direct directory listing. This is the same kind of bespoke terminal-rendering investment OpenCode makes with its `@opentui/*` stack, just under a different package name and without a matching desktop/web surface in this monorepo.

```

Note: `biome.json:35` still excludes `packages/mom/data/**/*`, but no `packages/mom` directory exists — `git log --all -- packages/mom` shows a commit `0ed0d434 "remove mom and pods packages"`; `packages/orchestrator` is a separate, still-present "experimental" package, not a renamed survivor of the deleted `mom`/`pods`. A second, independent instance of the same drift: `.husky/pre-commit` still special-cases `packages/web-ui/*` (triggering a browser-smoke check when any staged file matches `packages/ai/*|packages/web-ui/*|package.json|package-lock.json`), but `packages/web-ui` no longer exists in this checkout — `git log --all --oneline` surfaces the removal directly: `b141e1fa "chore: remove web-ui workspace"`. Both stale references are minor and harmless (an unused biome exclude, an unreachable hook branch), but they're honest signals that this is an actively-refactored monorepo where package boundaries move faster than every cross-reference gets cleaned up.

## Mental model for using it well

- **Read `docs/usage.md`'s exclusion list first.** MCP, sub-agents, permission popups, plan mode, to-dos, and background bash are all deliberately absent from core — if you need any of them, the answer is "build or install an extension," not "wait for it to ship."
- **Sessions are a real branchable tree, not a linear log.** `/fork`, `/clone`, and `/tree` operate on a JSONL file with `id`/`parentId` links; nothing is destroyed on rewind — `setLeafId` just moves the active pointer and appends a `leaf` marker.
- **Project-local `.pi/` is trust-gated, global `~/.pi/agent/` is not.** An untrusted repo's `.pi/extensions/*.ts` won't execute until you explicitly trust the project; don't assume opening a new repo silently runs its extensions.
- **The example `subagent/` extension is the reference implementation to copy, not a toy.** It spawns real, isolated `pi` child processes with scratch dirs and abort propagation — read `examples/extensions/subagent/index.ts` before rolling your own multi-agent orchestration.
- **MCP has to be built by you.** If a workflow needs MCP tool discovery, either wrap `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` yourself inside an extension, or accept the CLI-tool-with-README pattern the maintainers propose as the substitute.
- **Tool-call events are real and typed, but there's no built-in exporter.** `ToolCallEvent`/`ToolResultEvent` give you everything needed to build your own tracing extension (as `.pi/extensions/tps.ts` does for tokens/sec); don't expect OTLP or a trace file out of the box.
- **This checkout's own `.pi/` directory is the best worked example of every extensibility mechanism at once** — prompts, skills, and extensions, all real and exercised by the maintainers on their own release process.

## When NOT to reach for this

- **You need first-class MCP support out of the box.** There is no vendored MCP client or server anywhere in this checkout — you will be building that integration yourself as an extension.
- **You need a built-in permission/sandboxing layer.** `SECURITY.md` states plainly there isn't one; prompt injection and malicious-extension risk are explicitly out of scope for the project's own security process. If you need in-process containment, look elsewhere or bolt on your own (Docker/tmux/Gondolin are the suggested patterns, not a built-in).
- **You want sub-agent orchestration as a first-class, core-supported feature.** It exists only as an example extension you must install/adapt yourself; core ships nothing under that name.
- **You want distributed tracing or OTLP out of the box.** `@opentelemetry/api` is present only as an unused transitive dependency; there's no tracer or exporter wired up anywhere in the source.
- **You need XDG-spec-compliant config paths** (e.g., for packaging on a Linux distro that enforces XDG conventions). Pi hardcodes `~/.pi/agent/` (configurable only by literal env-var/package-name override), not `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.
- **You're looking for a stable, frozen public API to build long-term integrations against.** The presence of a stale `biome.json` exclude for a deleted `packages/mom`, and an "experimental" fifth package (`pi-orchestrator`), both signal an actively-shifting internal package boundary.

## How this compares to the study's other harnesses

| Axis | Pi | OpenCode | goose | aider |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Language/runtime** | TypeScript, npm workspaces (Node ≥22.19.0); no Bun, no Go | TypeScript, Bun-only (no Go anywhere in the tree) | Rust | Python |
| **Shape** | 5-package npm monorepo: pi-ai, pi-tui (leaves) → pi-agent-core → pi-coding-agent (CLI) → pi-orchestrator (experimental) | CLI + TUI + server + desktop (Electron) + web app, one shared core | CLI agent with extensions | CLI, git-native |
| **Tool/MCP model** | No vendored MCP anywhere (verified: zero `*mcp*` files/dirs outside docs/test-fixture mentions); tools are built-ins + extension-registered, no permission-rule engine | Full MCP client (local stdio + remote HTTP/SSE, OAuth); tools scoped per-agent via wildcard permission rules | Extensions are themselves MCP-wrapper shaped — "extensions-as-MCP-wrapper" harness | No MCP; tools are the diff/edit protocol plus repo-map context, not a discoverable tool registry |
| **Session persistence** | JSONL tree-of-entries per session (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/--cwd--/ts_uuid.jsonl`), version-3 header; real, shipped `/fork`/`/clone`/`/tree` branching via additive leaf-pointer moves | SQLite (Drizzle ORM, WAL mode, 38 migrations) for sessions/messages/parts; legacy JSON-file store with its own migration chain | (not verified in this profile — see goose's own profile) | Git commits are the persistence layer; no separate session database |
| **Tracing** | Typed in-process `ToolCallEvent`/`ToolResultEvent` hook API for extensions; no OTLP, no tracer, no exporter shipped in core (`@opentelemetry/api` present but unused) | Real OTLP export (`@effect/opentelemetry`, gated on env var) + `Effect.withSpan` on every tool execution carrying session/message/call IDs | (see goose profile) | (see aider profile — no built-in OTel; diffs and commits are the audit trail) |
| **Skills/agents/commands** | `.md`-file skills (`skills.ts`) + `.md`-file prompt templates with bash-style arg substitution (`prompt-templates.ts`); subagents real only as a first-party example extension, not core | Skills read from `.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, `.opencode/skill(s)`, config paths, and remote URLs; converge into one command namespace with MCP prompts and static commands | Extensions play the analogous role, wrapped as MCP | No formal skill/agent-definition system; behavior is driven by the repo-map + prompt |
| **Config layering** | Global `~/.pi/agent/` (unconditionally trusted) + project-local `<cwd>/.pi/` (trust-gated, two-pass bootstrap); no XDG support anywhere | Global (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) + project (walked-up `.opencode/opencode.json`) + env-var overrides | (see goose profile) | `.aider.conf.yml` + CLI flags; no MCP-server config surface to layer |
| **Best fit** | Teams wanting a small, auditable core with a genuinely serious branchable-session model, who are willing to build MCP/sub-agent/permission layers themselves as extensions | Teams wanting a database-backed, observable, multi-surface (TUI/server/desktop) coding agent with first-class MCP and skill ecosystems | Teams wanting a Rust-native agent where every capability is naturally MCP-shaped | Teams wanting a minimal, git-native pair-programming loop without a tool-call/MCP layer at all |

The crucial axis Pi owns in this study is **session-tree seriousness paired with deliberate core minimalism**: it is the only entry that ships real, additive, git-like session branching (`/fork`, `/clone`, `/tree` backed by parent-linked JSONL entries) as a core feature, while simultaneously refusing — by explicit, documented policy — to vendor MCP, sub-agents, or a permission system, pushing all three into an extension SDK it then dogfoods on its own repository via `.pi/`.

## One-line summary

> Pi is an npm-based (not Bun/pnpm) TypeScript monorepo — `pi-ai`/`pi-tui` as leaves, `pi-agent-core` for the session/harness engine, `pi-coding-agent` as the CLI, plus an experimental `pi-orchestrator` — whose core deliberately excludes MCP, sub-agents, permission popups, and a built-in tracer (`docs/usage.md:307`), yet ships a genuinely serious, additive, JSONL-backed session tree with real `/fork`/`/clone`/`/tree` branching (`CHANGELOG.md:3730-3736`) and a typed tool-call hook API that extensions (not core) turn into tracing, MCP, or sub-agent orchestration, most concretely demonstrated by the first-party `examples/extensions/subagent/` package that spawns isolated child `pi` processes exactly the way the project's own philosophy prescribes.
