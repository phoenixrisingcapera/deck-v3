lede: Every AutoGen team type overrides exactly one method — `select_speaker()` —
  and that single seam is the whole difference between them.
summary: 'Source-cited profile of the AutoGen 0.7.5 submodule (layered `autogen-core`/`autogen-agentchat`/
  `autogen-ext`) in the agent-harnesses study. This is the study''s entry for native
  multi-agent team orchestration: teams are actor-runtime topic graphs rather than
  Python loops, `select_speaker()` is the one overridden seam across Round Robin /
  Selector / Swarm / Magentic-One, and conversation state persists as a name-keyed
  `TeamState.agent_states` dict nesting each agent''s serialized `ChatCompletionContext`
  plus manager-specific turn counters. Also documents the direction of the MCP bridge
  — native `Tool`/`BaseTool`/`Workbench` came first, MCP is adapted into that shape
  behind an optional extra — which is the inverse of most other entries in the study.
  Note the maintenance-mode status before recommending it for new work.'

# AutoGen — Profile

A profile of AutoGen as it lives in this study (`studies/agent-harnesses/autogen/`). Cites pinned paths so you can jump to source rather than trust paraphrase. Read alongside [`Profile__OpenHands.md`](./Profile__OpenHands.md) (event-stream trace architecture) and any opencode profile in this study (CLI-first single-agent, own MCP client) — AutoGen is this study's entry for **native multi-agent team orchestration with an explicit, swappable turn-taking algorithm per team type**, layered under a distributed actor-style runtime rather than built as a single-agent loop with delegation.

`README.md:14,18-25` states the repo's current status plainly: **AutoGen is in maintenance mode** — "It will not receive new features or enhancements and is community managed going forward," with Microsoft steering new projects to [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework). This checkout is the 0.4+ generation (confirmed via `python/packages/{autogen-core,autogen-agentchat,autogen-ext}/pyproject.toml`, all `version = "0.7.5"`), the layered rewrite that replaced the 0.2.x monolithic `pyautogen` package (still present at `python/packages/pyautogen/` for migration reference, not read for this profile).

## TL;DR

The README's own architecture summary (`README.md:179-183`):

> The autogen _framework_ uses a layered and extensible design... [Core API] implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime... [AgentChat API] implements a simpler but opinionated API for rapid prototyping... [Extensions API] enables first- and third-party extensions.

Mechanically: **teams are actor-runtime topics, not a shared Python loop.** `BaseGroupChat._init()` (`python/packages/autogen-agentchat/src/autogen_agentchat/teams/_group_chat/_base_group_chat.py:191-245`) registers every participant as a `ChatAgentContainer` core-agent behind its own topic type (`f"{participant.name}_{team_id}"`), plus a group-chat-manager agent on a dedicated manager topic, plus a shared group topic all participants subscribe to for broadcast. Turn-taking isn't a for-loop over a list — it's `GroupChatRequestPublish` messages published to the runtime (`SingleThreadedAgentRuntime` by default, `_base_group_chat.py:141`) and consumed asynchronously.

**Speaker selection is delegated to a `select_speaker()` abstract method** (`_base_group_chat_manager.py:305-318`) implemented differently per team type: `RoundRobinGroupChatManager.select_speaker()` (`_round_robin_group_chat.py:72-82`) is a plain modular index increment; `SelectorGroupChatManager.select_speaker()` (`_selector_group_chat.py:152-217`) calls an LLM with a role-and-history prompt (`_select_speaker()`, `_selector_group_chat.py:232-308`), re-prompting on invalid/repeated/multi-name responses up to `max_selector_attempts` (default 3) before falling back to the previous speaker or first participant; `SwarmGroupChatManager.select_speaker()` (`_swarm_group_chat.py:82-98`) reads the `target` field off the most recent `HandoffMessage` in the thread — no model call at all, just a scan.

**Conversation state persists as a nested, per-agent-name dictionary, not a single transcript.** `BaseGroupChat.save_state()` (`_base_group_chat.py:748-796`) calls `AgentRuntime.agent_save_state()` on every participant plus the group-chat-manager and nests results under `TeamState.agent_states` keyed by **agent name** (not agent ID — `_base_group_chat.py:783-786` explicitly decouples state from runtime identity so state is portable across teams/runtimes). Each `AssistantAgent.save_state()` (`autogen-agentchat/src/autogen_agentchat/agents/_assistant_agent.py:1630-1633`) in turn delegates to its `ChatCompletionContext.save_state()` (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/model_context/_chat_completion_context.py:66-67`), which just dumps the raw `LLMMessage` list. Group-chat-manager state additionally carries algorithm-specific fields — `RoundRobinManagerState.next_speaker_index`, `SelectorManagerState.previous_speaker`, `SwarmManagerState.current_speaker` (all in `autogen-agentchat/src/autogen_agentchat/state/_states.py:43-61`) — so resuming a team restores not just messages but exactly where the turn-taking algorithm left off.

**Tool-calling is native-first, MCP-second, and the direction of the bridge matters.** `autogen_core.tools.Tool` (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/tools/_base.py:56-80`) is a `Protocol` with `run_json`/`save_state_json`/`load_state_json`; `BaseTool` (`_base.py:96-215`) and `FunctionTool` (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/tools/_function_tool.py:30`) are the native implementations, predating this checkout's MCP support. MCP is bridged **into** this native shape, not the reverse: `McpToolAdapter(BaseTool[BaseModel, Any], ABC, ...)` (`autogen-ext/src/autogen_ext/tools/mcp/_factory.py:29`) wraps a single `mcp.Tool` so it satisfies the native `Tool` protocol, and `Workbench` (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/tools/_workbench.py:78-93`) — also native-core, predating MCP — gets its own MCP-backed implementation, `McpWorkbench` (`autogen-ext/src/autogen_ext/tools/mcp/_workbench.py:47`). The `mcp` package is an optional extra (`autogen-ext/pyproject.toml:153`, `mcp = ["mcp>=1.11.0"]`), not a core dependency.

If you want one sentence: **AutoGen runs multi-agent "teams" as actor-runtime topic graphs where a pluggable `select_speaker()` method — round-robin index, LLM-prompted role selection, or handoff-message target-reading — decides the next turn, conversation state saves as a name-keyed nested dict of each participant's serialized `ChatCompletionContext` plus manager-specific turn-tracking fields, and tool-calling is fundamentally the native `Tool`/`BaseTool`/`Workbench` protocol with MCP wired in as an adapter layer (`McpToolAdapter`, `McpWorkbench`) behind an optional `[mcp]` extra, not the other way around.**

## Why this exists — three load-bearing design choices

1. **The group chat is a runtime topology, not a loop.** `BaseGroupChat._init()` (`_base_group_chat.py:191-245`) wires a `TypeSubscription` per participant (own topic + shared group topic) and one for the manager (own topic + group topic + output topic). This is why `Team` composes: a `RoundRobinGroupChat` can nest another `RoundRobinGroupChat` as one of its own participants (demonstrated in the docstring example, `_round_robin_group_chat.py:184-233`) — the inner team is just another `ChatAgentContainer`-wrapped agent from the outer team's perspective (`_chat_agent_container.py:79-81` checks `isinstance(self._agent, Team)` and calls `run_stream` on it instead of `on_messages_stream`).
2. **`select_speaker()` is the one seam every team type overrides — everything else in `BaseGroupChatManager` is shared.** `_transition_to_next_speakers()` (`_base_group_chat_manager.py:172-193`) is identical across Round Robin / Selector / Swarm; it awaits `self.select_speaker(self._message_thread)` polymorphically and publishes `GroupChatRequestPublish` to whichever topic(s) come back. Termination checking (`_apply_termination_condition`, `_base_group_chat_manager.py:195-228`), message-thread bookkeeping, and turn counting are all base-class, non-overridden logic.
3. **State save/load is decoupled from runtime identity on purpose.** The docstring on `save_state` (`_base_group_chat.py:766-771`) states this was a breaking change as of v0.4.9 specifically so saved state is "portable across different teams and runtimes" — moving from agent-ID-keyed to agent-name-keyed state. `load_state` (`_base_group_chat.py:798-830`) catches `pydantic.ValidationError` and raises a pointed error telling the caller the format changed and to read the release notes (`_base_group_chat.py:826-830`) — an explicit acknowledgment that old saved state will not silently load wrong.

## Turn-taking algorithms, compared at the source

All three managers subclass `BaseGroupChatManager` (`_base_group_chat_manager.py:25`) and only differ in `select_speaker()` + `reset()` + `save_state()`/`load_state()`:

- **RoundRobinGroupChatManager** (`_round_robin_group_chat.py:16-82`): `self._next_speaker_index = (current_speaker_index + 1) % len(self._participant_names)` (`_round_robin_group_chat.py:79-82`) — pure modular arithmetic, no model call, always returns exactly one speaker.
- **SelectorGroupChatManager** (`_selector_group_chat.py:50-341`): builds a `roles` block (name + description per participant, `_selector_group_chat.py:203-208`), formats the `selector_prompt` template with `{roles}`/`{participants}`/`{history}`, and calls `self._model_client.create(...)` (or `.create_stream` if `model_client_streaming`). `_mentioned_agents()` (`_selector_group_chat.py:310-341`) regex-matches the model's free-text response against participant names (handling underscore-vs-space and escaped-underscore variants), retries up to `max_selector_attempts` on zero or multiple matches, and can be overridden entirely by a user-supplied `selector_func` (sync or async, checked first, `_selector_group_chat.py:163-177`) or narrowed by a `candidate_func` that filters the participant pool before the LLM call (`_selector_group_chat.py:180-193`). `allow_repeated_speaker` (default `False`) excludes the previous speaker from candidates unless explicitly permitted.
- **SwarmGroupChatManager** (`_swarm_group_chat.py:15-113`): `select_speaker()` (`_swarm_group_chat.py:82-98`) walks `thread` in reverse looking for the most recent `HandoffMessage` and returns its `.target` field; if none exists, the current speaker continues. `validate_group_state()` (`_swarm_group_chat.py:47-73`) enforces that any handoff target is a real participant name, with an explicit error message pointing at `HandoffTermination` resume semantics — this is the mechanism `Swarm([agent], ...)` uses for human-in-the-loop handback (README's `HandoffTermination` example, `README.md` quickstart references this pattern in `agents/_assistant_agent.py`'s `handoffs=` parameter).

A fourth, more elaborate manager exists for `MagenticOneGroupChat` (state schema at `state/_states.py:64-72`: `task`, `facts`, `plan`, `n_rounds`, `n_stalls` — a planning-and-replanning orchestrator, not read in depth for this profile) under `teams/_group_chat/_magentic_one/`.

## Conversation-state persistence, end to end

Three nested layers, each with its own `save_state`/`load_state` pair:

1. **`ChatCompletionContext`** (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/model_context/_chat_completion_context.py:10-75`) is the lowest layer: an abstract base holding `self._messages: List[LLMMessage]`, with `add_message()` (line 55), `get_messages()` (abstract, line 60, implemented differently by `UnboundedChatCompletionContext`, `BufferedChatCompletionContext`, `HeadAndTailChatCompletionContext`, `TokenLimitedChatCompletionContext` — all in the same `model_context/` directory), and `save_state()`/`load_state()` (lines 66-70) that just round-trip `ChatCompletionContextState(messages=self._messages)`.
2. **`AssistantAgent.save_state()`** (`autogen-agentchat/src/autogen_agentchat/agents/_assistant_agent.py:1630-1633`) wraps that context dump in `AssistantAgentState(llm_context=model_context_state)` (schema at `state/_states.py:13-17`); `load_state()` (`_assistant_agent.py:1635-1639`) validates and forwards `llm_context` back into `self._model_context.load_state(...)`.
3. **`ChatAgentContainer.save_state()`** (`_chat_agent_container.py:197-202`) wraps the delegate agent's state plus its own pending `_message_buffer` (messages received but not yet delivered to the agent) in `ChatAgentContainerState` (`state/_states.py:35-40`) — this is the layer that exists purely because of the actor-runtime topology: a participant can have buffered-but-unprocessed messages at save time, and those need to round-trip too (`_chat_agent_container.py:204-213`).
4. **`BaseGroupChat.save_state()`** (`_base_group_chat.py:748-796`) is the outermost layer: it calls `self._runtime.agent_save_state(agent_id)` — note, the *runtime's* method (`SingleThreadedAgentRuntime.agent_save_state`, `autogen-core/src/autogen_core/_single_threaded_agent_runtime.py:880-881`, itself just delegating to the agent instance's own `save_state()`) rather than calling the agent object directly, "because we want to support saving state of remote agents" (comment at `_base_group_chat.py:790-791`) — the distributed-runtime case is designed in from this layer down, even though the default runtime is single-threaded/in-process.

Group-chat-manager state is saved through the identical `agent_save_state` path, keyed under `self._group_chat_manager_name` in the same `TeamState.agent_states` dict (`_base_group_chat.py:793-796`) — so a `RoundRobinGroupChatManager`'s `next_speaker_index` and a `SwarmGroupChatManager`'s `current_speaker` live right alongside participant states in one saved blob, not a separate file.

## Tool-calling — native `Tool`/`BaseTool`/`Workbench` first, MCP as an adapter

- **The native abstraction predates and is independent of MCP.** `Tool` (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/tools/_base.py:56-80`) is a `runtime_checkable` `Protocol` requiring `name`, `description`, `schema` (a `ToolSchema` TypedDict, lines 41-46), `args_type()`/`return_type()`/`state_type()`, `run_json()`, and `save_state_json()`/`load_state_json()`. `BaseTool` (`_base.py:96-215`) is the concrete ABC most tools subclass; `FunctionTool` (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/tools/_function_tool.py:30`) wraps a plain typed Python function/coroutine, deriving its `ToolSchema` from the function's type annotations via `args_base_model_from_signature`. `Workbench` (`autogen-core/src/autogen_core/tools/_workbench.py:78-93`) is a second, coarser native abstraction — "a set of tools that may share resources and state" — with async-context-manager start/stop lifecycle, used when tools need a live session (browser state, DB connection) rather than being stateless callables.
- **MCP support lives entirely in `autogen-ext`, gated behind an optional extra.** `autogen-ext/pyproject.toml:153`: `mcp = ["mcp>=1.11.0"]` — the `mcp` PyPI package is not a hard dependency of `autogen-ext`, matching the README's install instruction `pip install -U "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]"` (core install has no MCP) and the MCP quickstart's explicit `pip install "autogen-ext[mcp]"`-equivalent framing (`README.md:65-102`).
- **The bridge direction: MCP tools become native `Tool`s, not the reverse.** `McpToolAdapter(BaseTool[BaseModel, Any], ABC, Generic[TServerParams])` (`autogen-ext/src/autogen_ext/tools/mcp/_factory.py:29-56`) takes an `mcp.Tool` (the MCP SDK's tool descriptor) and an `McpServerParams`, converts the tool's JSON schema to a Pydantic model via `schema_to_pydantic_model` (line 50), and implements `run()` (`_factory.py:57-83`) by opening (or reusing) an `mcp.ClientSession` and calling `session.call_tool(...)`. Three concrete subclasses exist per transport — `StdioMcpToolAdapter`, `SseMcpToolAdapter`, `StreamableHttpMcpToolAdapter` (files `_stdio.py`, `_sse.py`, `_streamable_http.py`) — all produced by the single factory function `mcp_server_tools()` (`autogen-ext/src/autogen_ext/tools/mcp/_factory.py:10-214`), which lists the server's tools and returns one adapter instance per tool, ready to drop straight into an `AssistantAgent(tools=[...])` list alongside plain `FunctionTool`s.
- **`McpWorkbench` mirrors this at the coarser `Workbench` layer.** `McpWorkbench(Workbench, Component[McpWorkbenchConfig])` (`autogen-ext/src/autogen_ext/tools/mcp/_workbench.py:47`) wraps an entire MCP server (not just one tool) and additionally supports MCP Resources, Prompts, Sampling, Roots, and Elicitation (table at `_workbench.py:59-78`) via an optional `McpSessionHost` — this is the object used in the README's own MCP quickstart (`README.md:75,87`, `McpWorkbench(server_params)` passed as `workbench=mcp` to `AssistantAgent`), i.e., the README itself demonstrates the workbench path, not the raw `mcp_server_tools()` adapter path, as the recommended MCP entry point.
- **Net finding: both a native tool abstraction and MCP support exist, and they are not peers — MCP is deliberately downstream of and conformant to the native `Tool`/`Workbench` protocols**, which is why an `AssistantAgent`'s `tools=` list can freely mix `FunctionTool`, `McpToolAdapter` instances, and `AgentTool` (agent-as-tool, `autogen_agentchat.tools.AgentTool`, used in the README's multi-agent orchestration example, `README.md:106-151`) without the agent code needing to know which is which.

If you read three files: `autogen-agentchat/src/autogen_agentchat/teams/_group_chat/_base_group_chat_manager.py` (the shared turn-taking scaffold and the `select_speaker` seam), `autogen-agentchat/src/autogen_agentchat/teams/_group_chat/_selector_group_chat.py` (the most elaborate of the three concrete managers — LLM-prompted selection with retry/fallback), and `autogen-ext/src/autogen_ext/tools/mcp/_factory.py` (the exact shape of the MCP-to-native-tool bridge).

## Mental model for using it well

- **Pick the team type by how turn order should be decided**, not by feature checklist: Round Robin for deterministic fixed-order collaboration, Selector for LLM-judged dynamic routing among heterogeneous specialist agents, Swarm for explicit agent-declared handoffs (including human-in-the-loop via `HandoffTermination`).
- **Treat `save_state()`/`load_state()` on a `Team` as the unit of durability**, not per-agent state in isolation — the nested `TeamState.agent_states` dict is what actually round-trips a paused conversation, including exactly whose turn is next.
- **Reach for `Workbench`/`McpWorkbench` when tools share session state** (browser, DB connection); reach for plain `FunctionTool`/`McpToolAdapter` list entries when tools are stateless — both compose in the same `tools=`/`workbench=` agent constructor arguments.
- **A nested `Team` is a valid participant of another `Team`** — `ChatAgentContainer` treats `Team` and `ChatAgent` participants uniformly via an `isinstance` check, so hierarchical team-of-teams composition is a first-class pattern, not a workaround.
- **Given the maintenance-mode status (`README.md:18-25`), treat new capability gaps as permanent** unless the community fork/PR path resolves them — Microsoft's own guidance is to start new work on Microsoft Agent Framework instead.

## When NOT to reach for this

- **You're starting a new project today.** The README's own caution (`README.md:18-25,200-202`) is unambiguous: AutoGen is community-managed, bug-fixes-and-security-only, and Microsoft explicitly points new users at Microsoft Agent Framework.
- **You want a single-agent CLI harness with its own MCP client as the primary interaction mode.** AutoGen's unit of work is the multi-agent `Team`; a single `AssistantAgent` works but the framework's actual design weight (topics, `ChatAgentContainer`, group-chat managers) is multi-agent-first.
- **You need production-hardened authn/security out of the box for a no-code surface.** AutoGen Studio is explicitly flagged as prototyping-only, not production-ready (`README.md:160-164`).
- **You want tool-calling to *be* MCP** with no native abstraction underneath. AutoGen's tool layer is native-first (`Tool`/`BaseTool`/`Workbench` predate MCP support in this codebase); if the entire point of adoption is "we standardize purely on MCP as the tool contract," the native layer is an extra abstraction to reason around, not a pure pass-through.
- **You need a distributed, multi-process runtime out of the box.** The default `BaseGroupChat` runtime is `SingleThreadedAgentRuntime` (in-process); the "remote agent" and distributed runtime path is designed for (`agent_save_state`'s docstring comment) but a separate, heavier setup than the default.

## How this compares to the rest of the study

| Axis | OpenHands | opencode | AutoGen |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shape** | Multi-agent, event-stream trace architecture | CLI-first single-agent, own MCP client | Python framework, layered core/agentchat/ext, multi-agent teams as the primary unit |
| **Status** | Actively developed | Actively developed | **Maintenance mode** — bug fixes/security only (`README.md:18-25`) |
| **Multi-agent orchestration** | Event-stream-driven agent delegation | Not the primary unit (single-agent) | **First-class**: `Team` abstraction with 4 concrete turn-taking algorithms (Round Robin, Selector/LLM, Swarm/handoff, Magentic-One/planner) |
| **Turn-taking mechanism** | Not profiled here | N/A | Pluggable `select_speaker()` per manager — modular index, LLM-prompted with retry, or handoff-message-target scan |
| **Conversation-state persistence** | Not profiled here | Own session storage | Nested, name-keyed `TeamState.agent_states` dict; each agent's `ChatCompletionContext` messages + manager-specific turn state (e.g. `next_speaker_index`) |
| **Tool-calling model** | Not profiled here | Own MCP client, structured tool-call loop | **Native-first**: `Tool`/`BaseTool`/`Workbench` protocol predates MCP; MCP bridged in via `McpToolAdapter`/`McpWorkbench` behind an optional `[mcp]` extra |
| **Runtime substrate** | Event stream | Process/session model | Actor-style `AgentRuntime` (topics + subscriptions); default is in-process `SingleThreadedAgentRuntime`, designed for remote/distributed extension |
| **Best fit** | Tracing/observability-centric agentic coding | Terminal-first agent work, swappable MCP toolset | Existing AutoGen deployments, or new work specifically wanting a multi-agent team with an explicit, swappable speaker-selection algorithm — with eyes open about maintenance-mode status |

The axis AutoGen owns in this study is **turn-taking as an explicit, swappable algorithm with its own serializable state** — no other entry in this study exposes "how the group decides who talks next" as a single overridable method (`select_speaker`) with three (four, counting Magentic-One) shipped implementations and per-implementation state schemas that round-trip through a uniform team-level `save_state`/`load_state` contract.

## One-line summary

> AutoGen (0.7.5, layered `autogen-core`/`autogen-agentchat`/`autogen-ext`, now in Microsoft maintenance mode per `README.md:18-25`) runs multi-agent teams as actor-runtime topic graphs where `BaseGroupChatManager.select_speaker()` is the one seam three built-in team types override — `RoundRobinGroupChatManager`'s modular index, `SelectorGroupChatManager`'s LLM-prompted role selection with regex-mention parsing and retry/fallback, and `SwarmGroupChatManager`'s handoff-message-target scan — while conversation state persists as a `TeamState.agent_states` dict keyed by participant name (not runtime ID, deliberately decoupled since v0.4.9) nesting each agent's serialized `ChatCompletionContext` plus manager-specific turn-tracking fields; and tool-calling is native-first (`Tool`/`BaseTool`/`FunctionTool`/`Workbench` in `autogen-core`, predating MCP) with Model Context Protocol support bridged in as an adapter layer (`McpToolAdapter`, `McpWorkbench`) behind an optional `autogen-ext[mcp]` extra, not the framework's foundational tool contract.
