  and a session — and lands with no access, having been told they were invited to
  something.

# Invite redemption failure is logged, not surfaced

## What

`AccessController.attach_invited_membership/2` records
`invite_membership_failed` in `auth_events` and lets redemption continue. The
person gets an account and a session, but not the membership the invite was for.

## Why it matters

They clicked a link that said *"Alice invited you to join Apollo"* and arrived
somewhere with no Apollo. The failure is discoverable in `auth_events` — but only
by someone who thinks to look.

Failure modes that reach here: the entity was deleted between invite and
redemption, or the role string is no longer valid.

## Options

1. **Leave it.** The event exists; at three users someone will notice.
2. **Tell the person** — render a "something went wrong, ask whoever invited you"
   state rather than the generic done page.
3. **Tell the inviter** — email `issued_by` on failure.
4. **Refuse the redemption** so the token stays unclaimed and can be retried.
   Cleanest semantically, worst experience: they cannot sign in at all.

## Recommendation

Option 2 when the LiveView lands (increment 7). Not worth a bespoke page before
there is a UI to put it in.
