title: entities and organizations both exist
lede: 'Two tables now describe overlapping things: organizations carries domain-as-id
  and firm profiles, entities carries tenancy. Nothing is broken; the duplication
  will get resolved by accident if nobody decides it.'

# entities and organizations both exist

## What

`organizations` (PK = email domain, plus `firm_profiles`, plus org-wide
`memberships`) and `entities` (`kind: "organization" | "workspace" | "project"`,
plus `entity_memberships`) coexist.

`entities.org_id` links them, and is **descriptive only** — never consulted for
access or credential resolution (decision E1).

## Why it matters

A reader has to know which table answers which question. The risk is not
breakage, it is that a future change consults `entities.org_id` for access
because it happens to be there, quietly reintroducing the hierarchy Ruling 1
forbids.

## Options

1. **Leave both** with the descriptive-only rule enforced by convention and the
   comment in the migration.
2. **Collapse** `organizations` into `entities` with `kind: "organization"`, plus
   a side table for domain-as-id, billing and firm profile. One tenancy table,
   one membership table.
3. **Formalise the boundary** — keep both, but add a test asserting no query path
   reads `entities.org_id` for authorization.

## Recommendation

Option 3 now (cheap, prevents the actual failure), option 2 only if something
else forces a migration here.
