# Per-App Workspaces and the Chat as Optional Surface

> **Framework note (2026-05-18):** Code examples in this deck are React-shaped. The augment-it implementation is **Svelte 5** — matching memopop-ai and the broader Lossless family. The architectural distinction (per-app workspace, shared chat package, WorkspaceAdapter as the seam) is framework-neutral. When this deck becomes slides, the code snippets should be re-rendered in Svelte 5 syntax for accuracy.

## Why this deck exists

Over the course of designing the augment-it rewrite we walked through three architectural bets that *seemed* right and turned out wrong. Each iteration sharpened the next. The final shape is much cleaner than the first — but only because each rejection taught us something specific about the seam between business data and conversational UI.

This deck captures the journey for two audiences: the team (so future architectural conversations start from the right ground), and future-me (so we don't accidentally re-walk it in six months).

## Bet #1 — A universal `@lossless/workspace` package

The intuition: all three apps need to manage records / responses / state of truth somehow; let's share a package.

What broke it: the intersection of memopop's memos, dididecks's slide decks, and augment-it's CRM-augmentation records is too small. A universal type would be either a megablob of every entity any app might ever need, or an empty kernel everyone has to extend. Neither shape is useful.

What survived: the **shape of the workspace pattern**. Singleton state class, discriminated `activeView`, capability registry as the only mutation surface, SSE event ingestion with `lastSeenSeq` dedup, `MAX_EVENTS` cap. That shape is shareable as a discipline — codified in [[Per-App-Workspace-Conventions]] — without being a shared package.

## Bet #2 — State lives inside `@lossless/in-app-agent`

The intuition: the chat package is shared across apps; if we put the state container in there, every app gets state-sharing for free.

What broke it: three independent concerns.

- **Chat-primary isn't a given.** Not every app will use chat as the primary interaction mode. Some apps will use chat as a panel; some won't use it at all. Coupling state to chat assumes a UX shape we haven't decided.
- **Workflow tasks shouldn't require chat plumbing.** A headless CSV-augmentation runner should be able to operate against state without dragging chat dependencies along.
- **The chat can't be a clean shared-UI package if it owns business data.** Records, memos, slides, highlights — these are *each app's* domain, not the chat package's.

What survived: the chat-package idea itself. It's still shared (`@lossless/in-app-agent`), still UI, still owns conversational state — but it doesn't own business data. The seam to business data is a typed interface.

## Bet #3 — The corrected architecture

State lives **per-app**, in `@augment-it/workspace`, `@memopop-ai/workspace`, `@dididecks-ai/workspace`. Each:

- Holds its own domain entities (records, memos, slides, etc.)
- Owns its own capability registry
- Exposes its own `useWorkspace()` hook
- Provides its own `adapter` that satisfies `WorkspaceAdapter` (from `@lossless/in-app-agent`)
- Follows shared conventions ([[Per-App-Workspace-Conventions]]) so they don't drift

The chat package (`@lossless/in-app-agent`) is:

- UI-only — transcript, character-cast, AgentClient, the `<ChatSurface>` component
- Domain-agnostic — zero imports from any app's workspace
- Consumed via the `WorkspaceAdapter` interface, instantiated per-app

Both Window and Chat subscribe to the same per-app workspace singleton through Module Federation 2.0's `singleton: true` declaration. Realtime mirror is a consequence of being subscribers to the same store; no separate sync mechanism.

## The three-layer picture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ App-specific (shell, Window, federated remotes)          │
│  Imports from: @<app>/workspace and (optionally)         │
│                @lossless/in-app-agent                    │
└────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
       ┌─────────────┴────────────────┐
       ↓                              ↓

│  - useWorkspace │         │    interface (typed)         │
│  - adapter      │         │  - useChat() hook            │
└─────────────────┘         └──────────────────────────────┘

  Per-app, no shared        Shared across apps, optional
  data model                per app, zero domain knowledge
```

The chat package depends on a typed interface; each app implements it. The chat doesn't import from any specific app; apps don't have to import the chat at all.

## The WorkspaceAdapter — the seam

This is the single piece of code that *is* shared. Lives in `@lossless/in-app-agent`:

```ts
interface WorkspaceAdapter {
  subscribe(listener: () => void): () => void;
  getSnapshot(): WorkspaceSnapshot;
  invoke<T>(capability: string, args: unknown): Promise<CapabilityResult<T>>;
  getCapabilityRegistry(): CapabilityRegistry;
  jobEvents?: EventTarget;
}
```

The chat package uses the adapter for exactly two things:

1. **Enumerating capabilities** so it can present them as tool-use surfaces to the LLM
2. **Invoking capabilities** when the LLM emits a tool call

The chat never reads business entities directly. Record cards and memo sections and slide previews are rendered by *workspace-side* components, mounted by `<ActiveViewMount />` based on `workspace.activeView`. The chat's surface is the conversation; the workspace's surface is the data.

## Two singletons, not one

Apps that ship chat MF-singleton both packages:

- `@<app>/workspace` — singleton'd so all federated remotes see the same business state
- `@lossless/in-app-agent` — singleton'd so transcript and character-cast aren't duplicated per remote

If either is missed, the failure is silent — each remote gets its own instance, "shared state" fragments, and bugs appear that don't reproduce on a hard reload. The MF config has to be deliberate on both.

## useWorkspace + useChat — the hook split

Two hooks, two responsibilities:

```ts
// from @augment-it/workspace — business data
const { entities, activeView, jobs, user, tenant } = useWorkspace();

// from @lossless/in-app-agent — conversational state
const { transcript, cast, isStreaming, sendMessage } = useChat();
```

Most remotes import only `useWorkspace()`. Chat-specific components (a transcript pane, a character-cast widget) import `useChat()` additionally. Federation guarantees both hooks return data from the singletons no matter which remote is calling.

## Headless workflows prove the decoupling

The clearest test that we got the split right:

```ts
import { workspace } from '@augment-it/workspace';

async function nightlyEnrichmentRunner() {
  const jobId = await workspace.invoke('enrich.batch', {
    record_set_id: 'this-weeks-prospects',
    agents: ['social_profiles', 'web_crawl', 'press_mentions'],
  });
  for await (const event of subscribeToJob(jobId)) {
    if (event.stage === 'completed' && allAgentsDone(event)) break;
  }
  await workspace.invoke('crm.writeback', { record_set_id: 'this-weeks-prospects', target_crm: 'hubspot' });
}
```

No chat, no React, no UI. Just the workspace and its capabilities. **This script could not exist if state lived inside the chat package.** That it does is the proof of the decoupling.

## Naming conventions worth remembering

- Workspace packages: **full names**, no abbreviations — `@augment-it/workspace`, `@memopop-ai/workspace`, `@dididecks-ai/workspace`
- Singleton export: `workspace` — `import { workspace } from '@augment-it/workspace'`
- React hook: `useWorkspace()` — returns `WorkspaceSnapshot`
- Adapter export: `adapter` — passed to `<AgentProvider adapter={adapter}>`
- Active view kinds: `snake_case` — `'record_detail'`, `'enrichment_job'`
- Capability names: `entity.verb` — `'records.import'`, `'enrich.batch'`

The full names cost six characters over `@aug/*`; the benefit is zero collisions, no abbreviation drift, no "which app is `@aug`?" moments for new contributors.
