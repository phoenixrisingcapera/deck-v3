lede: Nobody wants to be the keymaster. So entities never own credentials — people
  lend them, lending is what makes you an admin, and when you walk away you take your

# Flexible entity relationships, to mirror messy IRL collaboration

## Why Care?

> *"I'm in situations all the time where people are collaborating on another
> person's keys because they have the credit card."*
>
> *"I live in a world of individuals and small teams often collaborating across
> boundaries, where there are new services and APIs and MCPs popping up all the
> time and basically no one wants to go be the keymaster."*
> — Michael, 2026-08-20

No mainstream identity model expresses this. Vendors assume the organization buys
the key, the organization owns it, and someone in IT administers it. In the world
this spec is for, one person expenses an API account, four people from three
companies build on it, and when that person moves on the honest questions are
*whose key was that*, *what did it pay for*, and *what breaks now*.

The design stance is **deliberately over-flexible**. This is not a spec that
tries to be airtight; it is a spec that tries not to make an arrangement
unrepresentable. The failure mode being optimised against is not a breach — it is
a real collaboration that the model refuses to describe.

## What already exists — do NOT relitigate

The [[Id-Didi-Sh-Identity-Service]] amendment of **2026-08-09** already settled
tenancy. Carried forward wholesale:

- **The workspace is the tenancy boundary, and the boundary secrets attach to.**
- **Membership is explicit and email-domain-independent** — stated there as an
  **invariant** precisely so a later reader does not "simplify" it back into a
  domain check. Reaffirmed here.
- **A domain is a self-signup convenience, never an identity.**
- **Organizations survive, demoted** — domain-as-id, grouping, billing, firm
  profiles; not the access boundary.
- `workspaces` and `workspace_memberships` exist, the latter carrying
  `granted_by` and `via ∈ invite / auto_join / seed`.

## Ruling 1 — there is no hierarchy in code

**Organization, workspace, and project are three conventional labels for the same
kind of thing.** In spirit they nest. In code they do not, and no containment is
stored.

The reason is empirical, not aesthetic: **projects are collaborations among many
organizations.** A project that belongs to one org is the exception, not the rule.
A workspace is, in the operator's words, *"just a common convention for something
in between an organization and a project."* Encode a hierarchy and the common
case — three companies on one project — becomes the thing you have to fight the
schema to express.

So:

- **One `entities` table.** `kind ∈ organization | workspace | project` is a
  **display label**, carrying no structural meaning and no special powers.
- **No `parent_id`. No containment. No inheritance of anything, ever.**
- **A person may belong to any number of entities**, independently, at any label.
- A credential lent to an entity is available **in that entity only**. It does not
  reach anything above, below, or beside it, because there is no above, below, or
  beside.

### Retraction of the previous ruling

Version `0.0.0.1` of this spec argued for single-parent containment, on the
grounds that many-to-many containment makes a DAG in which credential inheritance
is undefined — *"if project P is contained by workspaces W1 and W2 and both grant
an OpenAI key, which key does P use?"*

That objection was **entirely contingent on inheritance existing.** With no
inheritance there is no conflict to resolve: every loan names exactly one entity
and applies to exactly that entity — and where a lender wants breadth, they name
several entities explicitly (Ruling 2b), which is a list, not a hierarchy. The
tree bought determinism that flatness gets for free, and charged for it in
expressiveness. Withdrawn.

## Ruling 1b — memberships are independent; removal NEVER cascades

The membership half of Ruling 1, stated separately because it is the half a later
engineer will try to "fix."

People move fluidly, and their presences are not a set. An admin may want to:

- remove someone from a **workspace** but keep them on the **organization**;
- remove them from the **organization** but keep them in a **workspace**;
- remove them from a **workspace** but keep them on a **project**.

All three are ordinary. None is a data-integrity problem.

**INVARIANT: each membership row is independent. Removing a person from one
entity has no effect on their membership in any other entity, in any direction.**
No `ON DELETE CASCADE` between memberships, no "remove from org" that tidies up
workspaces, no notion of a membership being orphaned. A person who belongs to a
project and nothing else is in a perfectly normal state, not a dangling reference
waiting to be cleaned up.

Stated as an invariant for the same reason the 2026-08-09 amendment stated its
own: so a later reader does not simplify it back into something tidier. In
Okta-world, removing someone from the org removes them from everything, because
the directory says the org contains the rest. Here the org contains nothing.

### Offboarding is a declared list, not a consequence

People *will* want "remove Alice from everything," and they should have it — as an
**explicit multi-select** over the entities she is in, never as an implicit side
effect of removing one. Same shape as the cascade in Ruling 2b: declared by a
human, not derived from structure.

### Removal must disclose what it does NOT do

Symmetric to the lending disclosure in Ruling 2b. When removing someone from an
entity, show what survives:

> *Removing Alice from Acme Corp. She will keep access to: Apollo (project),
> Q3 Diligence (workspace).*

Without that line the remover believes they have offboarded someone who still has
access to three things — the most likely way this model produces a nasty
surprise. The flexibility is the point; the disclosure is what makes it safe
enough to live with.

### Entity links, if we want them at all

If it becomes useful to record that a project involves orgs A and B, do it as a
**purely descriptive** `entity_links` table — for breadcrumbs, grouping, and
display — and hold it as an invariant that it is **never consulted when resolving
access or credentials.** That is "in spirit parent-child, in practice not" made
literal. If that invariant ever feels inconvenient, the correct response is to
delete the table, not to consult it.

## Ruling 2 — credentials are *lent*, never owned by an entity

This is the core of the model, and the word is load-bearing.

**An entity never owns a credential.** A person lends one, and retains title the
entire time. There is no state in which a workspace "has" an API key the way it
has a name.

The lifecycle, in full:

1. **Lending.** A person attaches one of their credentials to an entity. The
   value stays theirs; the entity receives the *use* of it.
2. **Lending makes you an admin.** Not by appointment — **by contribution.** The
   person who put the key in is, by default, an admin of that entity for as long
   as the loan is live. This is the ruling that answers *"no one wants to be the
   keymaster"*: nobody is appointed keymaster, and whoever happens to lend is
   simply trusted with the room they just made usable.
3. **Walking away.** The lender ends the loan and takes their key. Nothing is
   destroyed.
4. **The entity is now keyless** — not broken, not deleted, just inert on that
   capability — **until someone else claims admin by lending theirs.**

An entity with no active loans is a perfectly valid entity. It has members,
history, and artifacts; it just cannot currently call anything that costs money.
That is an accurate description of a great many real projects between funding.

### Effective role

A person's role in an entity is the **greater of**:

- their assigned membership role (`entity_memberships.role`), if any — there may
  be no row at all, and
- `admin`, if they currently have at least one live loan to that entity.

When the last loan from a person ends, their *derived* admin ends with it; any
separately assigned role is untouched. Admin is therefore self-healing in both
directions — it appears when someone contributes and recedes when they stop,
without anyone filing a ticket.

### Lending does not require membership

The person with the credit card is frequently **not on the project**: an advisor,
an investor, a parent company, a founder funding a side effort, the operator
setting the whole thing up from another company's address. Requiring membership
to lend would break the primary use case this spec exists for.

So: **anyone may lend to an entity they can see.** A live loan confers derived
`admin` whether or not the lender holds a membership row. When the loan ends they
revert to whatever membership they had — possibly none, and that is a normal
resting state, not an error.

This is the third independence axis, and it follows from the first two:

**INVARIANT: membership and lending are independent. Removing someone's
membership does not end their loans; ending their loans does not remove their
membership.** Alice can be removed from Acme Corp and still be funding Apollo. If
you want both gone, do both — explicitly, per Ruling 1b.

### What the model deliberately does not do

It does not ask who is *allowed* to lend. Over-flexible by choice: in a world
where a new API shows up every week, the cost of asking permission to be useful is
higher than the cost of someone lending a key nobody needed.

## Ruling 2b — the cascade is a lender's gesture, not a directory's structure

> **One word, one concept — noted 2026-08-23.** The `parent:child` tag syntax
> shared by entities and domains (`entity:organization`, `domain:strategy`) also
> *cascades*: *"parent-child is not enforced, it is derived from the syntax, and
> can cascade."* That was first read here as a collision needing a rename. It is
> not. It is the same idea, and the rename would have cost the unity.
>
> **A cascade is declared propagation, not structural inheritance.** Someone
> asserts a relationship — by lending to a named set of entities, or by naming a
> chain — and what follows flows along it. What makes it a cascade rather than
> inheritance is that **no stored structure decides it**. That is why it sits
> beside Ruling 1 rather than against it: *hierarchy is not in code, but
> propagation is still declarable.* The colon chain is the declaring act for
> naming; `cascade_id` is the declaring act for authority.
>
> The credential sense below is the **extended** one — it carries a cap, a
> wind-down, and an end that pulls every loan at once, because authority needs
> those and a name does not. The syntax sense is the plainer general case.
>
> Both keep the same contrast with Okta: there the directory decides what flows,
> here a person does.

### The cascade is invoked, not stored *(operator, 2026-08-23)*

> *"Cascade means the parent-child behavior is only used when they are
> purposefully chained together. So a workspace is independent, but when called
> as `organization:workspace` then some parent-child behavior can be in the UX
> and how data is transformed, called."*

**The relationship is a property of the reference, not of the record.** This is
what makes Ruling 1 and cascading co-exist rather than compete:

- `entities.slug` is the identity. An entity referenced by its slug alone is
  **independent** — no parent, no children, nothing inherited. That is Ruling 1,
  unchanged.
- A **chained reference** — `organization:palmer-ai:workspace:q3-planning` — is
  a *different act*. Writing the chain is the declaration, and it is what
  authorises parent-child behaviour in the UX and in how data is transformed and
  fetched. The same workspace, invoked with parenthood.
- Nothing about the record changed. **Chain it and you get the behaviour; name it
  alone and you do not.**

So the chained form is derived per reference and never persisted as a tuple —
consistent with the existing ruling on `user:org:workspace:project` below:
*"Do not store it as a tuple — the copies would disagree."* One entity, many
possible chains, each true in the context that wrote it.

**Confirmed by the operator 2026-08-23:** `entities.slug.cascade` names the
**derived chained form**, built at call time. Not a stored column.

#### Why this is the useful shape

A workspace is genuinely shared. `q3-planning` may be invoked under Palmer AI on
Monday and under a joint venture on Tuesday, and **neither invocation is more
true than the other**. Store the parenthood and you have to pick one and fight
the schema for the second — which is the failure Ruling 1 retracted containment
to avoid. Declare it per reference and both are cheap.

It also explains why folder nesting has never needed enforcing: a path **is** a
written chain, so it already cascades, and a prefix test is what honouring it
looks like.

The contrast that makes this clear is Okta. Okta assumes a **tight** concept of
organization, a tight in-or-out, tight parent-child relationships, and
inheritance that follows from all of it. Access flows downhill because the
directory says the hill exists.

Here the hill does not exist — but the *gesture* people want still does. A lender
should be able to say, in one motion:

> *this organization, and everyone in it; that workspace, and everyone in it;
> that project, and everyone in it.*

That is a **cascade**, and the distinction from Okta is the whole point:

- In Okta, the cascade is **structural** — the directory decides what flows
  where, and the admin can only work with the shape it was given.
- Here, the cascade is **declared by the lender**, per lending act. It names an
  explicit set of entities. Nothing flows anywhere the lender did not name.

So one lending act may target several entities at once. It is still not
inheritance: no entity acquires a key because of its relationship to another
entity. Every reachable entity is one the lender pointed at.

**Consequences to hold:**

- A cascade is **a set of loans sharing a `cascade_id`**, not a new kind of
  object. End the cascade and every loan in it ends together — that is *"they
  take their keys."* End one entity's loan and the rest survive — partial
  withdrawal, which people will want the first time one collaboration sours and
  the others don't.
- **The spend cap belongs to the cascade; the meter reports per entity.** A
  lender is exposed on one card, so the ceiling that matters is the total across
  everywhere they lent. The breakdown they want to *read* is per entity — *"this
  project is burning it, that one isn't."* Cap at the cascade, attribute at the
  entity.
- **"Everyone in it" means everyone in it *later*, too.** Membership is dynamic,
  so a loan to an entity is a loan to whoever is in that entity for as long as
  the loan lives. The lending UI must say so plainly — *"this lends to the 3
  people in Apollo now, and anyone added to it later"* — because a lender who
  learns this after the fact will never lend again.

## Ruling 3 — separate the credential, the loan, and the artifact

"They take their keys with them" and "it's not destroyed per se" are both true and
about **different objects**. Conflating them is how this ends in an argument.

| Object | Belongs to | When the lender walks |
|---|---|---|
| **Credential** — the secret value | **The person**, always | Goes with them: exportable, revocable, deletable |
| **Loan** — an entity's right to *use* it | The lender's to give and end | Ends; that capability goes dark |
| **Artifact** — what was made through it: documents, indexes, memos, decks, embeddings | **The entity** | Stays |

Alice takes her key. The project keeps its work. What it loses is the
*capability*, and it should lose it **visibly**: *"Research search is
unavailable — the OpenAI key it used was lent by Alice Chen, and the loan has
ended,"* with a button to lend a replacement. Not a cryptic 401.

A credential value is **never copied into an entity.** A loan is a pointer plus
terms. This is "distribute capabilities, not secrets" from
[[Secrets-for-Collaborators-Who-Will-Never-Open-a-Terminal]], one level down.

## Ruling 4 — a lender needs a meter and a stop-button

Not as security posture. As the thing that makes lending survivable.

The reason people hesitate to lend a key is not missing ACLs. It is that once
lent, the lender is **blind and brakeless** — they cannot see what is being
charged to their card, and their only lever is the nuclear one: yank it, and
break several people's work with no warning.

So a loan carries terms, and the lender gets a view:

- **Attribution** — every use records the credential, the loan, the entity, the
  caller, the time, and a unit or cost figure where the provider gives one. The
  lender can answer *"what is my card paying for, and for whom."*
- **Spend cap** — optional, per period. Hitting it pauses the loan and notifies
  both sides. This is what makes leaving a key in place a reasonable act rather
  than an act of faith.
- **Expiry** — optional. Engagements end; loans should be able to end with them
  by default rather than by memory.
- **Wind-down notice** — a loan can be ended instantly, but the default is a
  grace window with notification, so the entity can find a replacement lender
  before anything stops working.

There is no `inherit_down` term. With no hierarchy there is nothing to inherit to.

## The two things that are not negotiable, and why

Given the explicit stance that this is not the moment for tight security, only
two constraints are held firmly — and both because **they are what makes
"lending" mean lending**, not because of any compliance frame:

1. **A borrower can never read the value.** Masked display only; no API returns
   it; it never enters a transcript. If Bob can read Alice's key, Alice did not
   lend it — she surrendered it, permanently, to everyone Bob will ever work
   with.
2. **Every use is attributed.** Without it the lender cannot make an informed
   decision about staying lent, so the rational move becomes never lending — and
   the whole model collapses back to everyone managing their own keys.

Everything else here can be loosened on contact with reality.

## The `user:org:workspace:project` idea, reframed

The colon tuple is worth keeping, but it is **not a path** — there is no
hierarchy to walk. It is an **acting context**: *who I am being right now*,
assembled from independent memberships that happen to co-occur.

It is **derived and sparse**. A person with no org shows `alice::…:apollo`. Render
it into audit rows and MCP resource URIs so a human reading a log can see the
context a capability was exercised in. Do not store it as a tuple — the copies
would disagree.

## Schema (proposed)

| Table | Notes |
|---|---|
| `entities` | `id` (UUIDv7), `kind ∈ organization / workspace / project` (**label only**), `slug`, `name`, `default_domain` (nullable, self-signup hint), `default_role`, timestamps. **No `parent_id`.** Generalises `workspaces`. |
| `entity_memberships` | `(didi_id, entity_id, role)`, unique on the pair, plus `granted_by` and `via ∈ invite / auto_join / seed` per the 2026-08-09 amendment. Generalises `workspace_memberships`. |
| `credentials` | `id`, `owner_didi_id` (**a person, never an entity**), `provider`, `label`, encrypted value, masked hint, `created_at`, `revoked_at`. |
| `credential_cascades` | One lending **act**. `id`, `credential_id`, `lent_by`, `lent_at`, `spend_cap`, `cap_period`, `expires_at`, `wind_down_until`, `ended_at`. **The cap lives here** — it is the lender's total exposure on one card. Ending this row pulls the key from every entity in the cascade at once. |
| `credential_loans` | One targeted entity. `id`, `cascade_id`, `entity_id`, `ended_at`. A row may end on its own (partial withdrawal) or with its cascade (*"take my keys"*). A live row confers derived `admin` on the cascade's `lent_by`. |
| `credential_usage` | Append-only: `credential_id`, `cascade_id`, `loan_id`, `entity_id`, caller `didi_id`, `app_slug`, `occurred_at`, `units` / `cost_estimate`. **Metered per entity, capped per cascade.** |
| `entity_links` | *Optional, descriptive only.* `(from_entity, to_entity, label)`. **Invariant: never consulted for access or credential resolution.** |

`organizations` (domain-as-id, billing, `firm_profiles`), `memberships` (org-wide
roles like `superuser`), `users`, `user_emails`, `sessions`, `login_tokens`,
`auth_events`, `apps` are unchanged.

Migration note: `workspaces` → `entities` with `kind: workspace`;
`workspace_memberships` → `entity_memberships`. Existing rows keep their ids.

## Open questions

1. **Does `organizations` survive as its own table**, or become `entities` rows
   with `kind: organization` plus a side table for domain-as-id, billing, and
   `firm_profiles`? The dual-vocabulary risk is real either way.
2. **Encryption posture for `credentials`** — envelope encryption per owner, or a
   single service key at rest? The unresolved half of parent **OQ#7**, and the
   piece that gates the non-client tier.
3. **Do artifacts derived from a lender's paid usage really stay?** This spec says
   yes. Worth confirming for the awkward case — embeddings generated entirely on
   Alice's key.
4. **Who sees `credential_usage`?** The lender certainly. Entity admins in
   aggregate? A member, for their own calls?
5. **Cost fidelity.** Most providers do not return per-call cost. Is a unit count
   plus a local price table honest enough, or does an approximate number start
   worse arguments than no number?
6. ~~**Can a loan be made to several entities at once?**~~ **Answered
   2026-08-20: yes — that is the cascade** (Ruling 2b). Remaining sub-question:
   when a cascade's cap is hit, does every entity in it stop at once, or does the
   lender get to say *"pause the noisy one, keep the rest running"*? The second is
   kinder and more work.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A project can involve people from several organizations with no containment
      anywhere in the schema
- [ ] A person can belong to a project and nothing else, then join an org and a
      workspace later, without re-onboarding
- [ ] Lending a credential makes the lender an admin of that entity automatically
- [ ] Ending the last loan leaves the entity keyless, intact, and with every
      artifact — and a named, actionable message where the capability was
- [ ] Another member can restore the capability by lending theirs, becoming admin
      in the process, with no appointment step
- [ ] A lender can name several entities in one lending act (org + workspace +
      project), and nothing is reachable that they did not name
- [ ] A lender can pull their key from an entire cascade in one motion, or from
      one entity while the rest of the cascade survives
- [ ] The lending UI states that a loan reaches whoever is in the entity **later**,
      not only its current members
- [ ] Removing a person from an organization leaves every workspace and project
      membership they hold untouched — and the reverse
- [ ] The removal UI names what the person will still have access to afterwards
- [ ] "Remove from everything" exists as an explicit multi-select, never as an
      implicit consequence of a single removal
- [ ] A non-member can lend to an entity and is admin of it while the loan is
      live, then quietly stops being anything when it ends
- [ ] A lender can see what their key was spent on, by whom, in which entity
- [ ] A lender can cap spend, and hitting the cap notifies rather than fails
      silently
- [ ] No borrower can read a credential value through any surface
- [ ] Membership remains email-domain-independent (2026-08-09 invariant holds)

## Anti-goals

- **No hierarchy, no inheritance** — Ruling 1. If a future need seems to want it,
  re-read the "collaborations among many organizations" line first. A cascade is
  not inheritance: it reaches only entities the lender named (Ruling 2b).
- **Not a vault.** Backing store stays parent **OQ#3**.
- **Not per-resource ACLs.** Which deck, which memo, which corpus stays in the
  services, per 2026-08-09.
- **Not a billing system.** `credential_usage` informs the lender; it does not
  invoice anyone.
- **Not a permissions cathedral.** Any member may lend. The model would rather
  admit an unnecessary key than block a useful one.
