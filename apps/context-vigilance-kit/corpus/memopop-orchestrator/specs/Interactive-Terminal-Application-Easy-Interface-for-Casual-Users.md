# Interactive Terminal Application — Easy Interface for Casual Users

**Status**: Draft (v0.0.1)
**Date**: 2026-03-24
**Author**: AI Labs Team

---

## Priority Feature: Integrate Content from Previous Versions

The most valuable feature this CLI enables — beyond convenience — is **human-in-the-loop content integration across versions**. Each pipeline run produces artifacts (research, sections, sources, fact-checks) that represent significant AI compute and, increasingly, human review. When re-running the pipeline, all of that prior work is discarded with `--fresh`. This is wasteful and frustrating.

The interactive CLI should offer an **"Integrate Content from Versions"** flow that lets users selectively carry forward, override, and curate content from prior runs.

### Source Selector (First Priority)

The Source Selector walks a user through every source the system has encountered across all versions of a deal, using the `3-source-catalog/` artifacts as the starting point.

**Flow:**

```
? Select firm: Humain Ventures
? Select deal: Metabologic

  Loading source catalog from v0.2.4...
  Found 42 sources across 7 sections

? How would you like to review sources?
  ❯ By section (walk through each section's sources)
    All sources (flat list, sorted by status)
    Only excluded sources (review what was removed)
    Only unverified sources (review uncertain ones)

── Section: Market Overview (8 sources) ──────────────

1/8  [INCLUDED] Goldman Sachs Research — GLP-1 Market Report
     URL: https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/...
     Status: Valid (HTTP 200) · Cited 3 times

     ? Source action:
       ❯ ✓ Keep (no change)
         ⭐ Emphasize (prioritize in next run)
         ✗ Exclude (remove in next run)

2/8  [EXCLUDED — INVALID] McKinsey — Metabolic Health Market 2025
     URL: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/...
     Status: HTTP 404 · Was cited 2 times before removal

     ? Source action:
       ❯ ✗ Keep excluded
         🔄 Override: I found the real URL (enter new URL)
         ⭐ Emphasize: Source is real, URL just moved
         ? Maybe: Flag for re-check on next run

3/8  [EXCLUDED — HALLUCINATED] Fake Perplexity Source
     URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/XXXXX-fake-path
     Status: Hallucination pattern detected

     ? Source action:
       ❯ ✗ Keep excluded (confirmed hallucination)
         🔄 Override: This is actually real (enter correct URL)
```

**Source Designations:**

| Designation | Meaning | Effect on Next Run |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Emphasize** | High-value source, prioritize | Research agents explicitly seek this source; writer prioritizes citing it |
| **Keep** | Source is fine as-is | No change, included normally |
| **Maybe** | Uncertain, re-check | Validation agent re-checks URL; source included tentatively |
| **Exclude** | Do not use | Source filtered out before writer sees it |
| **Override URL** | Source is real but URL changed | User provides correct URL; source status flipped to valid |

**Output:**

The Source Selector saves a `{Company-Name}_source-curation.json` in the **deal root directory** — NOT inside any version folder. This is critical: the human's curation work persists across ALL subsequent pipeline runs. Once a user has reviewed sources, every future version of that deal benefits from their judgment.

```
io/humain/deals/Metabologic/
├── Metabologic.json              # Deal config
├── source-curation.json          # ← Human-curated source designations (persists across versions)
├── inputs/                       # Deck, dataroom
└── outputs/
    ├── Metabologic-v0.2.4/       # Version-specific artifacts
    └── Metabologic-v0.2.5/       # Next run reads source-curation.json automatically
```

```json
{
  "deal": "Metabologic",
  "curated_at": "2026-03-24T10:30:00",
  "curated_from_version": "v0.2.4",
  "sources": [
    {
      "url": "https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/...",
      "designation": "emphasize",
      "notes": null
    },
    {
      "original_url": "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/old-path",

    },
    {

      "designation": "exclude",
      "notes": "Confirmed hallucination"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pipeline Integration:**

On the next pipeline run, agents read `source-curation.json` and:
1. **Research agents**: Include "emphasized" source URLs in search queries; exclude "excluded" URLs
2. **Cleanup gates**: Skip validation for "override" sources (user confirmed they're real); use corrected URLs
3. **Writer**: Prioritize citing "emphasized" sources
4. **Source cataloger**: Carry forward designations, mark which are user-curated vs. AI-determined

### Competitive Landscape Review (Second Priority)

The Competitive Landscape Review walks a user through every competitor the system has identified across ALL previous versions of a deal. It merges `1-competitive-evaluation.json` from every version, deduplicates by company name/URL, and presents a unified list for human classification.

This is important because:
- The AI classifications (`direct_competitor`, `adjacent`, `indirect_competitor`) are rough guesses
- Different versions may discover different competitors — the union is more valuable than any single run
- Human judgment about competitive positioning is critical for the investment thesis
- Once classified, this becomes canonical data that shapes the competitive landscape section across all future versions

**Flow:**

```
? Select firm: Humain Ventures
? Select deal: Metabologic

  Loading competitive analysis from all versions...
  v0.2.1: 12 competitors
  v0.2.2: 15 competitors
  v0.2.4: 19 competitors
  Merged & deduplicated: 24 unique competitors

? How would you like to review?
  ❯ All competitors (walk through each)
    Only AI-classified as "direct" (review first)
    Only new since last curation
    By category (grouped by AI classification)

── Competitor 1/24 ────────────────────────────

  Enzymedica
  AI classified as: direct_competitor
  Description: Leading enzyme supplement brand focusing on
    digestive health and metabolic support
  Key differentiator: Broad enzyme supplement portfolio with
    established retail distribution
  Overlap: Competes for same consumer seeking enzyme-based
    metabolic improvement
  Funding: Unknown
  Website: enzymedica.com
  First seen: v0.2.1

  ? Classification:
    ❯ 🎯 Primary Competitor (head-to-head, same market)
      ⚔️  Direct Competitor (overlapping product/market)
      🏛️  Incumbent Nose (established player sniffing at this space)
      ↗️  Indirect Competitor (different approach, same customer need)
      🔄 Loose Comparable (similar-ish, useful for context)
      💡 Inspiration Set (admire their approach, not a threat)
      ✗  Not a Competitor (remove from landscape)

  ? Add notes? (optional)
  > "Largest enzyme supplement brand. $200M+ revenue.

── Competitor 2/24 ────────────────────────────

  Twin Health
  AI classified as: indirect_competitor
  Description: AI-powered "metabolic twins" for drug-free

  ...

  ? Classification:
    ❯ ↗️  Indirect Competitor
      (digital approach vs biological — different mechanism,
       same patient population)
```

**Competitor Designations:**

| Designation | Meaning | Use in Memo |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Primary Competitor** | Head-to-head, same market, same customer, substitutable product | Featured prominently in competitive landscape section; direct comparison table |
| **Direct Competitor** | Overlapping product or market, but not identical | Listed in competitive section with differentiation analysis |
| **Incumbent Nose** | Established player (big pharma, big tech) that could enter this space | Mentioned as risk/moat consideration |
| **Indirect Competitor** | Different approach to the same customer need | Brief mention for market context |
| **Loose Comparable** | Useful for valuation comps or market sizing, not a real competitor | Used in funding/valuation context, not competitive section |
| **Inspiration Set** | Admire their GTM, tech, or business model; not a threat | May inform strategy discussion, not listed as competitor |
| **Not a Competitor** | AI was wrong, remove from landscape | Excluded from all future runs |

      "description": "Enzyme engineering for pharmaceuticals and industrial applications"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Pipeline Integration:**

On the next pipeline run, agents read `{Company-Name}_competitive-curation.json` and:
1. **Competitive researcher**: Skips companies marked "not_competitor"; focuses deeper research on "primary_competitor" and "direct_competitor"
2. **Competitive evaluator**: Uses human classifications instead of AI guesses; preserves human notes
3. **Writer**: Structures competitive landscape section using the human hierarchy — primary competitors get detailed comparison, indirect get brief mention, inspiration set informs strategy narrative
4. **Table generator**: Builds competitive comparison table using only primary + direct competitors
5. **One-pager**: Features primary competitors by name in the competitive positioning card

**Version Merging Logic:**

When loading competitors from multiple versions:
1. Scan all `outputs/*/1-competitive-evaluation.json` files
2. Deduplicate by company name (fuzzy match: "Twin Health" = "TwinHealth" = "twin health")
3. If the same competitor appears in multiple versions with different data, keep the most complete record (most non-null fields)
4. Track `first_seen_version` for each competitor
5. If a previous curation exists, carry forward human classifications and only prompt for NEW competitors not yet curated

### Table Proposals Review (Third Priority)

The Table Proposals flow runs the `table_generator` agent in a "propose" mode — it scans the memo sections and structured data, identifies opportunities for tabular presentation, and generates table drafts. The user then reviews each proposal interactively: approve, reject, edit column structure, or suggest a different table entirely.

This is valuable because:
- The AI identifies tabular data opportunities that humans miss (funding history buried in prose, team credentials scattered across paragraphs)
- But the AI also proposes tables that are wrong, redundant, or poorly structured
- Human review catches bad proposals before they pollute the memo
- Users can propose tables the AI didn't think of — "I want a comparison table of GLP-1 drugs vs. enzyme approaches"

**Flow:**

```
? Select firm: Humain Ventures
? Select deal: Metabologic (v0.2.4)

**Table Proposal Types:**

The agent proposes tables based on data it finds in structured artifacts:

| Proposal Type | Data Source | Typical Sections |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Funding History | state.json funding data, deck | Fundraising Round |
| Team Credentials | state.json team data, deck | Team |
| Competitive Comparison | competitive-evaluation.json, competitive-curation.json | Market Overview |
| Market Sizing | state.json market data, research | Market Overview |
| Traction Metrics | state.json traction data | Business Economics, Overview |
| Key Metrics Summary | Aggregated from all sections | Overview (Executive Summary) |

User-suggested tables use Perplexity Sonar Pro to research the data in real time.

```

**Pipeline Integration:**

On the next pipeline run, the `table_generator` agent reads `{Company-Name}_table-curation.json` and:
1. **Approved tables**: Generates and inserts without re-proposing
2. **Rejected tables**: Skips, does not regenerate
3. **Edited tables**: Uses the human-specified column structure
4. **User-suggested tables**: Calls Perplexity for data, then generates the table
5. **New proposals**: If the agent finds a new opportunity not in the curation file, it generates normally (will be reviewed next time the user runs the table review flow)

### Future Integration Features (Not Yet Specified)

These flows would also live under "Integrate Content from Versions":

- **Section Selector**: Walk through sections from a prior version, mark which to keep vs. regenerate
- **Fact-Check Review**: Walk through fact-check findings, confirm or dispute each, carry forward verified facts
- **Research Merger**: Combine research from multiple versions, dedup, and create a unified research base for the next run
- **Best-Of Assembly**: Select the best section from each version (e.g., v0.2.2's Team section was better than v0.2.4's) and assemble a composite memo

---

## Problem

The system currently has ~15 CLI commands spread across `src/main.py`, `cli/generate_one_pager.py`, `cli/generate_tables.py`, `cli/export_branded.py`, `cli/assemble_draft.py`, `cli/md2docx.py`, `improve-section.py`, and more. Each requires knowing:

- The exact command and module path
- Required flags (`--firm`, `--brand`, `--mode`, `--version`, `--fresh`)
- File paths to output directories, final drafts, or section files
- Which commands depend on which (e.g., you can't export before generating)

For the person who built the system, this is fine. For a partner, associate, or collaborator who just wants to generate a memo and get a PDF, it's hostile.

---

## Goal

A single entry point that guides users through every operation via interactive prompts:

```bash
python -m cli.app
```

No flags, no file paths, no command knowledge required. The application discovers available firms, deals, versions, and output states automatically and presents contextual options.

## Discovery & Auto-Detection

The app should automatically discover:

### Firms
Scan `io/` for firm directories. Each subdirectory with a `deals/` folder is a firm.

```python
firms = [d.name for d in Path("io").iterdir()
         if d.is_dir() and (d / "deals").exists()]
```

### Deals
Scan `io/{firm}/deals/` for deal directories. Each with a `{DealName}.json` is a configured deal.

```python
deals = [d.name for d in (Path("io") / firm / "deals").iterdir()
         if d.is_dir() and list(d.glob("*.json"))]
```

### Versions & State
Scan `io/{firm}/deals/{deal}/outputs/` for version directories. Read `state.json` for metadata.

### Available Sections
Read `2-sections/*.md` file listing for section improvement flow.

### Available Agents
Hardcoded registry mapping display names to agent functions/CLI commands.

## Progress Display During Pipeline

The pipeline has 33+ agents. The progress display should show:

1. **Completed agents** with checkmarks and elapsed time
2. **Current agent** with a live spinner and description
3. **Remaining agents** listed but dimmed
4. **Overall progress** bar or fraction (e.g., "12/33 agents")

```

### Implementation Note

LangGraph doesn't provide per-node callbacks out of the box. Options:
- **Wrapper pattern**: Wrap each agent function to print status before/after
- **State-based**: Each agent appends to `state["messages"]`, monitor from outside
- **Custom callback handler**: LangGraph supports custom callbacks via `config`

## Error Handling & Recovery

The app should handle common failures gracefully:

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Missing API key | "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set. Add it to .env or export it." |
| Missing dependencies | "WeasyPrint not installed. Run: uv pip install -e ." |
| No deals configured | "No deals found for Humain Ventures. Set up a new deal?" |
| Agent failure mid-pipeline | Show error, offer to resume from last successful agent |
| Network timeout | "Perplexity API timed out. Retry? (Y/n)" |

## Technical Architecture

### Entry Point

```bash
python -m cli.app          # Interactive mode (default)
python -m cli.app --help   # Show available non-interactive commands
```

### Dependencies

| Library | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `rich` | Panels, tables, spinners, progress, colors | Already installed |
| `questionary` or `InquirerPy` | Interactive prompts (select, confirm, text) | Needs install |
| Everything else | Existing pipeline code | Already installed |

### Module Structure

```

### Theme Constants

```python
# cli/theme.py
BRAND_COLOR = "#51A084"      # Accent (matches Humain's Lochinvar)
PRIMARY_COLOR = "#090E18"    # Dark
SECONDARY_COLOR = "#656F84"  # Muted text
SUCCESS = "green"

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Shell + Generate Flow
- `cli/app.py` with main menu
- `cli/discovery.py` for firm/deal/version detection
- Generate flow with confirm and live progress
- Post-run summary

### Phase 2: Export + One-Pager Flows
- Export flow wrapping `cli/export_branded.py` and `cli/md2docx.py`
- One-pager flow wrapping `cli/generate_one_pager.py`
- "Open in browser" option after HTML export

### Phase 3: Improve + Agent Runner
- Section improvement flow wrapping `improve-section.py`
- Agent runner with categorized agent menu
- Resume-from-failure support

### Phase 4: Configuration
- New deal setup wizard (creates `{DealName}.json` from prompts)
- New firm setup (creates `io/{firm}/` directory structure)
- API key configuration
- Default settings (model, strictness, etc.)

## Open Questions

1. **Python or Node for the shell?** Rich + questionary is native Python and works today. clack (Node) is prettier but requires a bridge to call Python commands. Hybrid possible: Node shell that spawns Python subprocesses.

2. **Should the app replace `src/main.py`?** Currently `src/main.py` is the CLI entry point for generation. The app could wrap it, or `src/main.py` could become a library function called by the app.

3. **Pipeline progress granularity**: LangGraph doesn't expose per-node progress natively. We need to decide between wrapper functions (invasive but precise) vs. message monitoring (non-invasive but less real-time).

4. **Configuration persistence**: Should the app remember the last firm/deal selected? A `.cli-state.json` in the project root could store recent selections for faster repeat runs.

5. **Multi-deal batch mode**: Should the app support "Generate memos for all deals in Humain"? This is a power-user feature but valuable for firms with many deals.
