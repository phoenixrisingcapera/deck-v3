# Introducing a Diagram Generator Agent

**Status**: Draft
**Date**: 2026-03-09
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-09
**Author**: AI Labs Team

## Executive Summary

Investment memos benefit enormously from visual diagrams that communicate complex concepts at a glance. This specification introduces a `diagram_generator.py` agent that scans memo sections for opportunities to insert visual diagrams, starting with TAM/SAM/SOM market sizing and expanding over time to include a catalog of diagrams commonly used in finance and consulting.

The key technical challenge is **cross-format export compatibility**: diagrams must render correctly in HTML, PDF, and DocX exports. This document evaluates rendering approaches and recommends a strategy.

---

## Goals

1. **Identify diagram opportunities** by analyzing section content for concepts that benefit from visualization
2. **Generate diagrams programmatically** from data extracted during research and writing phases
3. **Ensure export compatibility** across HTML, PDF, and DocX output formats
4. **Build a growing catalog** of diagram types mapped to common investment memo concepts

---

## Diagram Catalog

### Phase 1: TAM/SAM/SOM Market Sizing (Initial)

**Diagram type**: Concentric circles (nested)
**Sections where applicable**: Market Context
**Data sources**: Research phase market data, deck analysis
**Use case**: Show total addressable market, serviceable addressable market, and serviceable obtainable market as nested circles with dollar figures and growth rates.

**Example structure**:
- Outer circle: TAM ($50B)
- Middle circle: SAM ($12B)
- Inner circle: SOM ($800M)
- Annotations: CAGR percentages, year projections

### Phase 2: Finance and Consulting Diagrams (Future)

| Diagram Type | Use Case | Applicable Sections |
|---|---|---|
| **Competitive Landscape Matrix** | 2x2 quadrant positioning companies by two key dimensions | Market Context, Business Overview |
| **Blue Ocean Strategy Canvas** | Line chart comparing value curves across key competing factors, highlighting differentiation and uncontested market space | Market Context, Business Overview, Investment Thesis |
| **Funding Waterfall** | Visualize funding rounds, dilution, and cap table progression | Funding & Terms |
| **Revenue Model Breakdown** | Pie or treemap showing revenue streams | Business Overview, Traction & Milestones |
| **Organizational Chart** | Team structure and key hires | Team |
| **Technology Stack Diagram** | Architecture layers and integrations | Technology & Product |
| **Risk Heat Map** | Probability vs. impact matrix for identified risks | Risks & Mitigations |
| **Milestone Timeline** | Horizontal timeline of achieved and planned milestones | Traction & Milestones |
| **Porter's Five Forces** | Industry competitive dynamics | Market Context |
| **Value Chain Diagram** | Where the company sits in the value chain | Business Overview |
| **Unit Economics Funnel** | CAC, LTV, conversion rates through funnel stages | Traction & Milestones |
| **Fund Portfolio Construction** | Allocation pie chart or bar chart (for fund memos) | Portfolio Construction |
| **GP Track Record Chart** | Returns by vintage year or fund (for fund memos) | Track Record Analysis |

## Technology and Rendering Strategy

### The Core Problem

Diagrams must work in three export formats:
- **HTML**: Flexible, supports JavaScript libraries and SVG natively
- **PDF**: Generated via WeasyPrint from HTML/CSS; no JavaScript execution
- **DocX**: Generated via Pandoc from Markdown; limited to embedded images

JavaScript-based charting libraries (D3.js, Chart.js, Mermaid.js in-browser) only work in live HTML. They cannot render in PDF or DocX pipelines. We need a strategy that produces **static image assets** that all three formats can consume.

### Recommended Approach: Mermaid CLI + SVG/PNG Export

**Primary tool**: [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) via `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` (mmcli)

**Why Mermaid**:
- Text-based diagram definitions (easy for LLMs to generate)
- CLI tool (`mmdc`) renders to SVG or PNG without a browser
- Supports many diagram types: flowcharts, pie charts, quadrant charts, timelines, mindmaps
- Active ecosystem, widely adopted
- Diagrams are defined in Markdown-friendly syntax

**Rendering pipeline**:
1. Agent generates Mermaid diagram definition (text)
2. `mmdc` CLI renders definition to SVG (preferred) and PNG (fallback)
3. SVG/PNG saved to `output/{Company}-v0.0.x/diagrams/`
4. Markdown image reference inserted into section: `![TAM/SAM/SOM](diagrams/tam-sam-som.svg)`
5. Export pipelines consume the image file:
   - **HTML**: `<img>` tag referencing SVG (crisp at any scale)
   - **PDF**: WeasyPrint renders embedded SVG/PNG from HTML
   - **DocX**: Pandoc embeds PNG into Word document

**Mermaid limitations and workarounds**:
- Mermaid does not natively support concentric circle diagrams (TAM/SAM/SOM). For Phase 1, we may need a supplementary approach for this specific diagram type.
- **Fallback for unsupported types**: Use `matplotlib` or `plotly` (with `kaleido` for static export) to generate SVG/PNG for diagram types Mermaid cannot handle.

### Alternative/Supplementary: Python Libraries for Custom Diagrams

For diagrams that Mermaid cannot express (e.g., concentric circles, complex custom layouts):

| Library | Strengths | Output Formats |
|---|---|---|
| **matplotlib** | Full control, concentric circles easy, widely available | SVG, PNG, PDF |
| **plotly + kaleido** | Interactive HTML + static SVG/PNG export | SVG, PNG, HTML |
| **drawsvg** | Lightweight SVG generation, no heavy dependencies | SVG |
| **diagrams (mingrammer)** | Cloud architecture diagrams | PNG |

**Recommended hybrid approach**:
- Use **Mermaid** for structured diagrams (flowcharts, timelines, quadrants, pie charts)
- Use **matplotlib** for custom/quantitative diagrams (TAM/SAM/SOM circles, waterfalls, funnels)
- All output as **SVG** (primary) with **PNG** fallback
- Store all diagram assets in `output/{Company}-v0.0.x/diagrams/`

### File Format Decision: SVG vs PNG

| Factor | SVG | PNG |
|---|---|---|
| Scalability | Infinite (vector) | Fixed resolution |
| File size | Small for simple diagrams | Larger at high DPI |
| HTML support | Native | Native |
| WeasyPrint (PDF) | Supported | Supported |
| Pandoc (DocX) | Must convert to PNG | Native |
| Text searchability | Yes | No |

**Decision**: Generate both SVG and PNG. Use SVG as primary for HTML/PDF exports. Use PNG for DocX exports. The agent saves both formats; the export scripts select the appropriate one.

## Agent Design

### Placement in Pipeline

The diagram generator runs **after the Writer** and **before Citation Enrichment**, similar to the existing enrichment agents:

```
Writer → Trademark Enrichment → Socials Enrichment → Link Enrichment
       → Diagram Generator (NEW) → Citation Enrichment → ...
```

The agent needs access to:
- Written section content (to identify diagram opportunities)
- Research data (for quantitative values to populate diagrams)
- Deck analysis data (for extracted metrics)

### Agent Function Signature

```python
def diagram_generator(state: MemoState) -> dict:
    """Scan sections for diagram opportunities, generate and embed visual diagrams."""
    # 1. Load section files from 2-sections/
    # 2. Analyze each section for diagram opportunities
    # 3. Extract data points from research/deck analysis
    # 4. Generate diagram definitions (Mermaid text or matplotlib code)
    # 5. Render to SVG + PNG via mmdc or matplotlib
    # 6. Save to output/{Company}-v0.0.x/diagrams/
    # 7. Insert image references into section markdown
    # 8. Save updated sections back to files
    return {
        "messages": ["Generated N diagrams across M sections"],
        "diagrams_generated": diagram_manifest  # list of generated diagram metadata
    }
```

### Diagram Opportunity Detection

The agent uses an LLM call to analyze each section and determine:
1. Whether the section content would benefit from a diagram
2. Which diagram type is most appropriate
3. What data points are available to populate the diagram

This can be guided by the YAML outline system -- each section definition could include a `suggested_diagrams` field:

```yaml
sections:
  - number: 3
    name: "Market Context"
    suggested_diagrams:
      - type: "tam_sam_som"
        trigger: "market size data present"
      - type: "competitive_quadrant"
        trigger: "3+ competitors identified"
```

---

## Dependencies

### Required

```bash
# Mermaid CLI for structured diagrams
pnpm add -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# matplotlib for custom diagrams (already likely in Python deps)
uv pip install matplotlib
```

### Optional

```bash
# For interactive HTML diagrams with static export
uv pip install plotly kaleido

# For lightweight SVG-only generation
uv pip install drawsvg
```

Add to `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
diagrams = ["matplotlib", "plotly", "kaleido"]
```

## Output Structure

```
output/{Company-Name}-v0.0.x/
├── diagrams/
│   ├── 03-tam-sam-som.svg
│   ├── 03-tam-sam-som.png
│   ├── 03-competitive-landscape.svg
│   ├── 03-competitive-landscape.png
│   ├── 06-funding-waterfall.svg
│   ├── 06-funding-waterfall.png
│   └── diagram-manifest.json    # metadata about all generated diagrams
├── 2-sections/
│   ├── 03-market-context.md     # now contains ![](diagrams/03-tam-sam-som.svg)
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

The `diagram-manifest.json` tracks what was generated:
```json
[
  {
    "section": "03-market-context",
    "type": "tam_sam_som",
    "renderer": "matplotlib",
    "svg_path": "diagrams/03-tam-sam-som.svg",
    "png_path": "diagrams/03-tam-sam-som.png",
    "data": {"tam": 50000000000, "sam": 12000000000, "som": 800000000}
  }
]
```

## Export Integration

### HTML Export (`export-branded.py`)

- SVG images render natively via `<img>` tags
- For inline SVG (better for theming), the export script can embed SVG content directly
- Diagrams inherit brand colors via CSS variables or by passing brand palette to the generator

### PDF Export (WeasyPrint)

- WeasyPrint renders SVG and PNG from `<img>` tags in the HTML intermediate
- No additional work needed if HTML export handles images correctly

### DocX Export (`md2docx.py` / Pandoc)

- Pandoc embeds PNG images from markdown `![](path.png)` syntax
- The export script should rewrite SVG references to PNG references before Pandoc processing
- Alternatively, use `cairosvg` to convert SVG to PNG at export time

---

## Open Questions

1. **Brand-aware diagrams**: Should diagrams use brand colors from the active brand config? This would make diagrams visually consistent with the exported memo but adds complexity.
2. **Diagram regeneration**: If a section is improved via `improve-section.py`, should diagrams be regenerated? Likely yes, but needs coordination.
3. **LLM-generated vs rule-based**: Should the agent use an LLM to generate Mermaid/matplotlib code, or should we build templates that get filled with data? LLM generation is more flexible but less predictable.
4. **Concentric circle rendering**: Mermaid lacks native concentric circle support. Confirm matplotlib is the right choice for TAM/SAM/SOM, or evaluate custom SVG generation with `drawsvg`.
5. **Diagram density**: How many diagrams per memo is appropriate? Too many may dilute impact. Consider a configurable maximum per memo or per section.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: TAM/SAM/SOM (MVP)
- Implement `diagram_generator.py` agent
- matplotlib-based concentric circle renderer
- SVG + PNG output to `diagrams/` directory
- Image reference insertion into Market Context section
- Basic export integration (HTML + PDF)

### Phase 2: Mermaid Integration
- Add Mermaid CLI rendering pipeline
- Implement competitive landscape quadrant (Mermaid quadrant chart)
- Implement milestone timeline (Mermaid timeline)
- Add funding waterfall (matplotlib or Mermaid)

### Phase 3: Outline-Driven Diagram Suggestions
- Add `suggested_diagrams` field to YAML outlines
- Agent reads outline to determine which diagrams to attempt
- Implement remaining diagram types from catalog
- Brand-color-aware rendering

### Phase 4: DocX Export and Polish
- PNG fallback pipeline for Pandoc/DocX
- Diagram regeneration on section improvement
- Configurable diagram density limits
