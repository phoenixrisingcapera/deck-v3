# Model Scorecard Agent and Template System

**Status**: Planning
**Date**: 2025-11-27
**Author**: AI Labs Team
**Related**: Format-Memo-According-to-Template-Input.md, Multi-Agent-Orchestration-for-Investment-Memo-Generation.md

---

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the addition of a **Model Scorecard Agent** and supporting **Scorecard Template System** to the Investment Memo Orchestrator. This feature enables VC firms to:

1. **Define proprietary scoring frameworks** as structured YAML templates
2. **Systematically evaluate investments** against firm-specific criteria
3. **Generate scorecard visualizations** embedded in memos
4. **Provide contextual rationale** for each score dimension
5. **Differentiate memo output** from generic AI-generated analysis

The goal is to integrate the firm's "proprietary insights and thinking" into the automated memo generation process, preventing output from becoming too generic to provide real value.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

**Issue #1: Generic Output Risk**
- AI-generated memos risk being too generic
- Without firm-specific frameworks, analysis lacks differentiation
- Memos may not reflect the firm's actual investment thesis
- Value to the firm diminishes when output looks like any other AI content

**Issue #2: No Structured Scoring Framework**
- Current system lacks mechanism for systematic evaluation
- Investment decisions are implicitly embedded in prompts
- No way to codify and reuse a firm's evaluation methodology
- Difficult to compare investments against consistent criteria

**Issue #3: Manual Scorecard Creation**
- The Class 5 Global memo shows a 12-dimension scorecard manually added
- These scorecards take significant time to create thoughtfully
- No AI assistance for scoring rationale generation
- Scorecards disconnected from the research/writing pipeline

**Issue #4: Missing Contextual Guidance for Agents**
- Research and writer agents lack awareness of what the firm values
- No mechanism to tell agents "we care about X dimension"
- Agents can't prioritize research around scoring criteria
- Results in memos that don't address firm-specific concerns

### The Class 5 Global Example

The existing LP commitment memo demonstrates a sophisticated 12-dimension scorecard:

| Dimension | Score | Percentile | Description |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Empathy | 4/5 | Top 25% | Insight-driven empathy with founders |
| Theory of Market | 4/5 | Top 5% | Well-sharpened theory on market evolution |
| Ecosystem Imprint | 5/5 | Top 5% | Memorable to founders and brokers |
| Hustle | 5/5 | Top 2% | Super-human omnipresence |
| Pull Force | 5/5 | Top 5% | Become the "go-to" investor |
| Pounce | 4/5 | Top 10% | Move quickly with prepared diligence |
| Integrity | 4/5 | Top 20% | Waver-less integrity in drama |
| Grip | 4/5 | Top 10% | Deep trust enables continued access |
| Judgement | 5/5 | Top 5% | Codified systems for deal selection |
| Discipline | 3/5 | Top 20% | Purposeful with limited focus |
| Positioning | 5/5 | Top 10% | Differentiated, unique market position |
| Prudence | 4/5 | Top 10% | Exercise outstanding prudence |

**Key Observations**:
- Each dimension has a **score**, **percentile rank**, and **descriptive rationale**
- Scorecards are split across sections represented as either table columns or table rows. 
- Placement is strategic (after Executive Summary, within Strategy, within Track Record)
- Descriptions are substantial (30-60 words each explaining what the dimension means)

# Dimension definitions
dimensions:
  empathy:
    name: "Empathy"
    short_description: "Insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators"
    full_description: |
      The ongoing privilege to invest in competitive early-stage deals rests on deep,
      insight-driven empathy with founders, management, and operators. Reputational
      feedback loops are tight and have outsized effects.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How well does the GP understand founder psychology and motivations?"
        - "What evidence exists of deep relationships with portfolio founders?"
        - "Do founders seek this GP's advice beyond investment matters?"
        - "What is the GP's reputation among founders they didn't invest in?"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Founder references"
        - "Portfolio company testimonials"
        - "GP's founder-facing content and communications"
      red_flags:
        - "Transactional relationships with founders"
        - "Limited follow-on from existing portfolio founders"
        - "Negative feedback from founders on deal that didn't close"
    scoring_rubric:
      5: "Exceptional founder relationships; founders actively seek GP's involvement; strong reputation even among non-portfolio founders"
      4: "Strong founder empathy; good references; founders recommend GP to others"
      3: "Adequate relationships; standard investor-founder dynamics"
      2: "Surface-level relationships; limited founder advocacy"
      1: "Transactional approach; poor founder feedback"

  theory_of_market:
    name: "Theory of Market"
    short_description: "Well-sharpened theory on market evolution and company building"
    full_description: |
      The ability to anticipate the performance horizon of companies at the earliest
      stages looks like intuition and luck, but it's forged from creating a well-sharpened,
      experience and information rich theory on market evolution and company building.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Can the GP articulate a clear, differentiated market thesis?"
        - "How has their thesis evolved with market changes?"
        - "What evidence supports their market predictions?"
        - "Do they have unique information advantages in their focus areas?"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Written thesis documents"
        - "Public talks and podcasts"
        - "Portfolio company selection patterns"
        - "Timing of investments relative to market trends"
      red_flags:
        - "Vague or generic thesis (e.g., 'AI is big')"
        - "Thesis that doesn't explain portfolio construction"
        - "No evidence of thesis refinement over time"
    scoring_rubric:
      5: "Highly differentiated, proven thesis with clear track record of prescient investments"
      4: "Clear thesis with supporting evidence; some proven predictions"
      3: "Articulate thesis but limited differentiation or track record"
      2: "Generic thesis; hard to distinguish from market consensus"
      1: "No clear thesis; reactive rather than anticipatory investing"

  ecosystem_imprint:
    name: "Ecosystem Imprint"
    short_description: "Memorable presence among founders, brokers, and syndicate investors"
    full_description: |
      The first few investment rounds of any company are put together through deeply
      formed interpersonal relationships and off-the-cuff recommendations. Even good
      investors can be quickly forgotten and be left out. Outstanding investors are
      uniquely memorable to a large group of busy, high-velocity founders, relationship
      brokers, and syndicate investors.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How well-known is this GP in their target ecosystem?"
        - "Do other investors proactively share deals with this GP?"
        - "Is the GP a 'must-have' on cap tables in their space?"
        - "What is their visibility at key industry events?"

      5: "Category-defining presence; automatically included in best deals; 'must-have' investor"
      4: "Well-known in ecosystem; regularly receives proactive deal flow"
      3: "Recognized but not top-of-mind; adequate deal access"
      2: "Limited ecosystem presence; struggles for deal access"
      1: "Unknown in target ecosystem; relies on cold outreach"

  hustle:
    name: "Hustle"
    short_description: "Super-human level of omnipresence and energy"
    full_description: |
      Rising above the world of existing early-stage venture firms requires
      sweat-inducing levels of energy. The methods are myriad, but the result
      is a super-human level of omnipresence. GPs are somehow at the right events,
      have met with the right founders, are in the right deals, all before lesser
      investors even get a strategy together.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "What is the GP's meeting cadence and founder outreach volume?"
        - "How quickly do they respond to opportunities?"
        - "Are they consistently present at key ecosystem events?"
        - "Do they create their own deal flow through proactive outreach?"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Meeting and outreach metrics"
        - "Event attendance and hosting"
        - "Response time to opportunities"
        - "Content production and thought leadership"
      red_flags:

        - "Slow response to opportunities"
        - "Limited proactive founder engagement"
    scoring_rubric:
      5: "Exceptional energy; omnipresent in ecosystem; creates own luck through relentless activity"
      4: "High energy; proactive approach; consistently present"
      3: "Adequate activity level; standard VC engagement"
      2: "Below average activity; reactive approach"
      1: "Passive; minimal proactive engagement"

  pull_force:
    name: "Pull Force"
    short_description: "Become the 'go-to' investor for their market thesis"
    full_description: |
      As a company becomes a clear breakout opportunity, many founders short-cut
      running an investment process with the wider venture market. They figure out
      who the "go-to" investors are, and the rounds are done quickly. Great investors
      become a "go-to" for their market thesis and investment strategy.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Do founders specifically seek out this GP?"
        - "Is the GP's name synonymous with a particular space?"
        - "How often do they win competitive deals?"
        - "Are they getting allocation in oversubscribed rounds?"

        - "Not associated with any particular space"
        - "Struggles to get allocation"
    scoring_rubric:
      5: "Category leader; founders specifically seek them out; wins most competitive deals"
      4: "Strong pull; recognized expert in space; good win rate"
      3: "Adequate brand; sometimes wins competitive deals"
      2: "Limited brand recognition; rarely wins competitive"
      1: "No pull; unknown or avoided by quality founders"

  pounce:
    name: "Pounce"
    short_description: "Move quickly with prepared, built-in due diligence"
    full_description: |
      Momentum rounds are circulated and closed in such short-order, the only way
      to participate is to move quickly, seemingly shortcutting professional process.
      The due diligence is there, but it's prepared and built into the DNA of the firm.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How quickly can the GP make investment decisions?"
        - "Do they have pre-built conviction in their focus areas?"
        - "Is their diligence process efficient without being shallow?"
        - "Have they lost deals due to slow process?"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Time from first meeting to term sheet"
        - "Deal velocity metrics"
        - "Pre-existing research in focus areas"

        - "Lost deals due to slow diligence"
        - "No pre-built conviction or research"
    scoring_rubric:
      5: "Lightning fast; pre-built conviction enables rapid decisions; wins on speed"
      4: "Quick mover; efficient diligence; rarely loses to timing"
      3: "Standard pace; sometimes misses time-sensitive deals"
      2: "Slow process; frequently loses to faster investors"
      1: "Glacial; process prevents competitive participation"

  integrity:
    name: "Integrity"
    short_description: "Waver-less integrity in difficult moments"
    full_description: |
      At least 40% of partner time deals in drama of some kind. And most report
      that eventually 60% of all their investments will underperform. Being a
      shareholder across this recurring drama requires waver-less integrity in
      moments that may otherwise bring out the worst in lesser stakeholders.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "How does the GP behave when companies struggle?"
        - "Do they maintain supportive relationships through difficulties?"
        - "What is their reputation for fair dealing?"
        - "How do they handle conflicts of interest?"

      3: "Adequate integrity; no major concerns"
      2: "Some concerns; mixed references"
      1: "Poor reputation; integrity issues documented"

  grip:
    name: "Grip"
    short_description: "Deep trust enables continued access in growth rounds"
    full_description: |
      After companies achieve breakout momentum, growth investors line up and
      compete to get into tightly controlled rounds. The best early-stage investors
      have deep trust with founders and board directors, so often get continued
      access to invest in the company even when others are locked out.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "What is the GP's follow-on investment rate in winners?"
        - "Do they maintain pro-rata in competitive growth rounds?"
        - "How strong are board relationships?"
        - "Do founders want them to continue investing?"

      5: "Exceptional grip; always maintains access; founders insist on continued participation"
      4: "Strong grip; usually maintains pro-rata; trusted board member"
      3: "Adequate grip; sometimes maintains access"
      2: "Weak grip; frequently loses access in growth rounds"
      1: "No grip; systematically squeezed out"

  judgement:
    name: "Judgement"
    short_description: "Codified systems for repeatable deal selection"
    full_description: |
      Firms with reputations will find themselves awash in opportunities. The
      resulting volume is incomprehensible without deliberate systems for repeating
      and scaling a codified sense of judgement — applied across screening, selecting,
      and securing access to those deals that best fit the firm and their strategy.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Does the GP have a systematic investment process?"
        - "How do they filter high-volume deal flow?"
        - "Is their selection criteria consistently applied?"
        - "Can they articulate why they passed on deals?"
      evidence_sources:
        - "Investment process documentation"

      4: "Strong process; good filtering; mostly consistent"
      3: "Adequate process; some systematization"
      2: "Inconsistent; ad hoc decisions"
      1: "No system; chaotic decision making"

  discipline:
    name: "Discipline"
    short_description: "Purposeful focus despite distractions and peer pressure"
    full_description: |
      VC Firms will see a rise of distractions, hyped opportunities, and implicit
      peer-pressure. Inclinations to abandon process, retro-fit strategy to mirror
      haphazard portfolio construction, or neglect the important for the urgent.
      Firms must be purposeful with their limited focus and capital.
    evaluation_guidance:
      questions:
        - "Does the GP stick to their stated strategy?"
        - "How do they handle FOMO on hot deals outside their focus?"
        - "Is portfolio construction consistent with thesis?"

## Workflow Integration

### Why Scorecard Runs Late in the Pipeline

The scorecard agent must run **after** the memo content is written and enriched because:

1. **Scoring requires context**: The scorecard evaluates the investment based on synthesized analysis, not raw research data
2. **Sections contain the evidence**: The written sections (Team, Track Record, Strategy) contain the structured analysis needed to score dimensions accurately
3. **Citations provide credibility**: Enriched citations give the scorer confidence in the underlying claims
4. **Holistic assessment**: The scorecard is a final synthesis layer, summarizing the memo's findings into structured scores

**Anti-pattern avoided**: Scoring before writing would force the scorecard agent to duplicate the writer's synthesis work, leading to inconsistency between scores and narrative.

**Key insight**: The scorecard runs in the "Scoring & Validation Phase" because it:
- Reads the completed, enriched memo sections
- Scores based on the synthesized content (not raw research)
- Inserts scorecard tables into the already-written sections
- Acts as a final analytical layer before validation

### New Agents

#### 1. Scorecard Agent (`src/agents/scorecard_agent.py`)

**Position in Pipeline**: After TOC, Before Citation Validator (late in pipeline)

**Why this position**:
- All sections are written and enriched with citations
- TOC has been generated (section structure is finalized)
- Scorecard can read the full memo content to generate accurate scores
- Scorecard tables will be inserted before final validation

**Responsibilities**:
1. Load appropriate scorecard template based on investment type
2. **Read completed memo sections** to evaluate each dimension
3. Score each dimension based on memo content + research data
4. Generate rationale that references specific memo content
5. Determine percentile rankings
6. Save scored scorecard to artifacts

**Input**:
- `state["research"]` - Research data (supplementary)
- `state["deck_analysis"]` - Deck analysis (supplementary)
- `state["investment_type"]` - "direct" or "fund"
- `state["scorecard_template"]` - Optional custom template name
- **Section files from `2-sections/`** - The actual written memo content

**Output**:
```python
{
    "scorecard": {
        "template_id": "hypernova-emerging-manager-v1",
        "scores": {
            "empathy": {"score": 4, "percentile": "Top 25%", "rationale": "..."},
            "theory_of_market": {"score": 4, "percentile": "Top 5%", "rationale": "..."},

## Research Agent Context Injection (Optional Enhancement)

### Rationale
Even though the scorecard is generated **late** in the pipeline (after writing), the **scorecard template** can still guide research **early**. The template defines what dimensions matter to the firm, so the research agent can proactively gather evidence for those dimensions.

This is a "forward-looking" optimization: the template informs research, and then the completed memo content (informed by that research) is scored later.

### Problem
The research agent currently doesn't know what the firm cares about. It performs generic research without guidance on what evidence to prioritize.

### Solution
Inject scorecard **template** dimensions (not scores) into research agent prompts to guide evidence collection.

**Modified Research Agent**:

```python
def research_agent_enhanced(state: MemoState) -> dict:
    """Enhanced research with scorecard awareness."""

    # Load scorecard template for context
    scorecard_template = None
    if state.get("scorecard_template"):
        scorecard_template = load_scorecard_template(state["scorecard_template"])
    elif state["investment_type"] == "fund":
        scorecard_template = load_scorecard_template("hypernova-emerging-manager")

    # Generate search queries
    base_queries = generate_standard_queries(state["company_name"])

    if scorecard_template:
        # Add scorecard-guided queries
        scorecard_queries = generate_scorecard_queries(
            state["company_name"],
            scorecard_template
        )
        all_queries = base_queries + scorecard_queries
    else:
        all_queries = base_queries

    # Execute searches...
    results = execute_searches(all_queries)

    # Synthesize with scorecard context
    if scorecard_template:
        synthesis = synthesize_with_scorecard_context(results, scorecard_template)
    else:
        synthesis = synthesize_standard(results)

    return {"research": synthesis}


def generate_scorecard_queries(company_name: str, template: dict) -> List[str]:
    """Generate research queries based on scorecard dimensions."""

    queries = []
    agent_context = template.get("agent_context", {}).get("research_agent", {})

    # Use template-defined queries
    for query_template in agent_context.get("search_queries_template", []):
        queries.append(query_template.format(gp_name=company_name))

    # Add dimension-specific queries
    for dim_id, dim_def in template["dimensions"].items():
        evidence_sources = dim_def.get("evaluation_guidance", {}).get("evidence_sources", [])
        for source in evidence_sources[:2]:  # Top 2 evidence sources
            queries.append(f"{company_name} {source.lower()}")

    return queries
```

## Writer Agent Context Injection (NOT Recommended)

### Why This Doesn't Work

In the original (incorrect) design, I proposed injecting scorecard scores into the writer prompts. This is **not possible** because:

1. **Scorecard runs after writing**: The scorecard agent needs the completed memo to generate scores
2. **Circular dependency**: Writer can't use scores that don't exist yet
3. **Duplication of effort**: If writer had scores, the scorecard agent would be redundant

### Alternative: Outline-Based Guidance

Instead of scorecard injection, the writer should receive guidance from the **outline** about what the firm values. The outline's `guiding_questions` and `vocabulary` serve this purpose.

If a firm wants the writer to emphasize certain dimensions, they should:
1. Add relevant guiding questions to the outline sections
2. Include dimension-related vocabulary guidance
3. NOT try to inject scorecard scores (which don't exist yet)

### The Correct Flow

```
Research (uses template dimensions to guide queries)
    ↓
Writer (uses outline guiding questions, NOT scores)
    ↓
[Enrichment agents]
    ↓
Scorecard Agent (reads completed memo, generates scores)
    ↓
Scorecard Enrichment (inserts score tables into sections)
```

---

## Outline Integration

### Updated Outline Schema

Outlines can now reference scorecard templates:

```yaml
# templates/outlines/custom/lpcommit-emerging-manager.yaml

metadata:
  outline_type: "fund_commitment"
  version: "1.0.0"
  extends: "../fund-commitment.yaml"

  # NEW: Scorecard integration
  scorecard:
    template: "hypernova-emerging-manager"
    required: true
    placement_enabled: true

# Section-specific scorecard notes
sections:
  - number: 1
    name: "Executive Summary"
    # ... standard fields ...

    scorecard_integration:
      include_summary: true
      highlight_dimensions: ["hustle", "ecosystem_imprint", "positioning"]
      summary_format: "Brief mention of standout scores"

  - number: 3
    name: "Fund Strategy & Thesis"
    # ... standard fields ...

    scorecard_integration:
      embed_group: "execution_style"
      position: "within"
      after_paragraph: 1
```

---

## Company Data Integration

### Updated Company Data Schema

Add scorecard template specification to company data files:

```json
{
  "type": "fund",
  "mode": "justify",
  "outline": "lpcommit-emerging-manager",
  "scorecard_template": "hypernova-emerging-manager",
  "description": "Class 5 Global Fund II LP commitment",
  "url": "https://class5global.com",
  "notes": "Focus on emerging markets, MENA region"
}
```

### Selection Logic

1. Check company data for `scorecard_template` field
2. If not specified, check outline for scorecard reference
3. If outline specifies required scorecard, load default for investment type
4. If no scorecard applicable, skip scorecard agents

## Example Output

### Before (Without Scorecard)

```markdown
## 1. Executive Summary

We committed capital to Class 5 Global's debut fund in 2018, backing a team
focused on early-stage technology investments across emerging markets...

[Standard narrative without structured evaluation]
```

### After (With Scorecard)

```markdown
## 1. Executive Summary

We committed capital to Class 5 Global's debut fund in 2018, backing a team
focused on early-stage technology investments across emerging markets with
particular emphasis on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region...

| Empathy | Theory of Market | Ecosystem Imprint | Hustle |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 4/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Top 25% | Top 5% | Top 5% | Top 2% |
| The ongoing privilege to invest in competitive early-stage deals rests on deep, insight-driven empathy with founders... | The ability to anticipate the performance horizon of companies at the earliest stages... | The first few investment rounds of any company are put together through deeply formed interpersonal relationships... | Rising above the world of existing early-stage venture firms requires sweat-inducing levels of energy... |

Our investment thesis centered on the GP's strategic positioning in underserved
emerging markets, differentiated access through Finkelstein's UAE base, and the
team's early-stage investment discipline...

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Over-Scoring Bias
**Issue**: LLM might default to high scores
**Mitigation**:
- Strict rubrics with clear criteria for each level
- Require evidence citation for scores >3
- Confidence indicators for low-data dimensions
- Percentile context to calibrate expectations

### Risk 2: Inconsistent Scoring
**Issue**: Same GP might get different scores on re-run
**Mitigation**:
- Temperature=0 for scoring agent
- Deterministic prompt structure
- Evidence-based scoring (not vibes)
- Save and version scorecard artifacts

### Risk 3: Scorecard Placement Conflicts
**Issue**: Tables might break section flow
**Mitigation**:
- Clear placement rules in template
- "after" placement as safe default
- Human review before publishing
- Preview mode for testing

### Risk 4: Template Maintenance Burden
**Issue**: Scorecards require ongoing refinement
**Mitigation**:
- Version control for templates
- Inheritance system for custom templates
- Clear documentation
- Feedback loop from usage

## Appendix: Complete Dimension Definitions

The full 12-dimension emerging manager scorecard is defined in detail in this document's "Scorecard Template Schema" section. Each dimension includes:

1. **Name and descriptions** (short + full)
2. **Evaluation guidance** (questions, evidence sources, red flags)
3. **Scoring rubric** (1-5 scale with detailed criteria)
4. **Placement rules** (which section, where in section)

This structure ensures consistent, thoughtful evaluation while making the firm's investment framework explicit and reusable.
