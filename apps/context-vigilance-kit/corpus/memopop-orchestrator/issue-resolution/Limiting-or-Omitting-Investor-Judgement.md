# Limiting or Omitting Investor Judgement

## Problem summary

The orchestrator's writer and closing-assessment agents render a *verdict* on whether the firm should invest — `PASS`, `CONSIDER`, or `COMMIT` — and they do this **unconditionally**, on every run, regardless of the analyst's intent in producing the memo.

In `consider` mode this is partially expected: the outline (`templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml` and firm-specific descendants such as `alpha-jwc-7Cs-customized.yaml`) lists `PASS / CONSIDER / COMMIT` as the recommendation options. The model dutifully picks one. But the analyst's reason for generating the memo is not always *"decide for me whether to invest."* Far more often, the analyst is preparing a memo to **present to the investment committee in support of a deal they have already decided is worth presenting**. In that context, an automated `PASS` rendered at the end of the document is not "neutral analytical output." It is the system overriding the analyst's stated direction — and doing so publicly, in the same document the analyst plans to hand to colleagues.

## The triggering incident (2026-06-07, Panthalassa-Deck-Series-B v0.0.2)

The user generated v0.0.2 of the Panthalassa memo. Mode was set to `consider` (the standard prospective-analysis mode). The closing section rendered a `PASS` recommendation. The user's response, verbatim:

> "Why the fuck is it telling me to pass on a company I am trying to present to the investment team? Yeah, the mode is consider, but I didn't ask it to pass."

The user is not arguing that the model's reasoning was wrong. Even if every analytical conclusion in the document were correct, **a system that renders unsolicited PASS verdicts cannot be safely placed in the analyst's IC-prep workflow.** The cost of a false-positive PASS is asymmetric: a single agent-rendered `PASS` in a memo the analyst intends to advocate for is a credibility hit the analyst then has to manually overwrite or apologize for. The cost of an omitted verdict is zero — the analyst writes their own recommendation.

## Why the current behavior is wrong

Three distinct framings, all converging on the same conclusion:

### 1. The analyst is the decision-maker; the memo is the analyst's instrument

In a venture firm, investment recommendations are made by humans accountable to capital. The memo is a tool the analyst uses to communicate with the partnership. An agent that auto-renders `PASS` is asserting decision authority it does not have and was not granted — even when the prompt nominally invites that output.

### 2. Mode = `consider` is about analysis posture, not delegation of judgement

`consider` was designed to mean *"the memo evaluates the opportunity prospectively"* (vs. `justify` which is retrospective). Conflating *posture* (prospective vs. retrospective) with *verdict-rendering authority* (who calls PASS) was an implicit modeling decision that the current architecture inherits without intending to.

### 3. The default behavior is the wrong default

In any system where one of the outputs has high asymmetric cost, the default must protect against the high-cost case. Here:

- Cost of an agent-rendered PASS the analyst didn't want: high (credibility, IC time, analyst frustration, possibly the deal).
- Cost of an omitted verdict when the analyst wanted one: low (analyst writes 1–3 sentences).

The default should be **omit**. Verdict-rendering should be explicit opt-in via the analyst's input, not default-on.

## What other agent outputs share the same shape

This is not just about the `PASS / CONSIDER / COMMIT` verdict — it's a category of agent overreach. Other instances:

- **Closing-assessment prose** that summarizes "the case against" without being asked, when the analyst's intent is "make the case for."
- **Citation enrichment** that adds skeptical citations to balance bullish prose (the system trying to be "fair" in a context where the analyst wanted advocacy).
- **Risks-section autonomy** — the Alpha JWC outline explicitly front-loads Risks (intentionally), but even within that, the section sometimes renders meta-commentary like "these risks suggest caution is warranted." The analyst asked for risks articulated; they didn't ask for caution-rendering.
- **Scorecards** that produce numeric "buy / hold / sell" type aggregations the firm doesn't actually use that way.

## Resolution direction (not yet implemented)

This issue is a stub for the conversation. The eventual resolution probably composes the following:

1. **Couple verdict-rendering to analyst `intent:`** (per the proposed `intent:` field in [[Per-Deal-Focal-Points]]). When `intent: present-for-commit`, the writer should not render a contradicting verdict. When `intent: rule-out`, the writer can render `PASS` freely. When `intent: present-for-consider` or `intent: exploratory`, the writer renders the verdict with caveats explicit.
2. **Default to omission for verdict-shaped outputs.** Sections like Cash on Cash Return Probability should end with analyst-prompt placeholders (e.g., *"Analyst recommendation: [ ]"*) rather than agent-rendered verdicts, unless the analyst's `intent:` explicitly authorizes a verdict.
3. **Separate "analytical conclusion" from "recommendation."** It's fine for a section to conclude *"the bull-case math requires capturing 8% of category share by year 5, which has been done by 2 of 11 comparable companies."* That is analysis. Rendering *"Therefore: PASS"* is judgement. Today these are entangled.
4. **Tone calibration per `intent:`.** Advocacy mode = lean bullish, surface counter-arguments inside Risks (the front-loaded section already exists for this), avoid meta-commentary. Rule-out mode = lean skeptical, demand strong evidence for any bullish claim.
5. **Reaffirm the outline as a contract.** The outline lists `PASS / CONSIDER / COMMIT` as *available* outputs for the Recommendation section. Available ≠ required. The writer should be told that *"required_terms"* in the outline are required *if a recommendation is rendered at all*, not that a recommendation must be rendered.

## Where the bug surfaces in code

- `src/agents/writer.py` — the per-section writer, particularly when handling the final section (number 9 in alpha-jwc-7Cs-customized, named "Cash on Cash Return Probability"). The structure_template explicitly lists `"Recommendation: [PASS / CONSIDER / COMMIT]"` as a required element. The writer renders it.
- `src/agents/revise_summary_sections.py` — if this agent revises closing/summary sections it inherits the same verdict-rendering expectation.
- `src/agents/validator.py` — may score-penalize a section that *omits* the recommendation, creating a reverse-pressure on the writer to always include one.
- The outline YAML itself (`templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml`, `io/alpha-jwc/templates/outlines/alpha-jwc-7Cs-customized.yaml`) — the `required_elements` and `recommendation_options` blocks are the contractual source of the requirement.

## Related

- [[Per-Deal-Focal-Points]] — the sister spec where the `intent:` field is proposed; this issue is one of the primary motivations for that field
- [[Separating-Retrieval-from-Generation-in-Agent-Pipelines]] — broader architectural direction; the verdict-rendering issue is the *prose-and-tone* analog of the citation-fabrication issue
- [[Faked-Sources-from-Perplexity]] — similar pattern of "agent doing more than asked, with asymmetric downside cost"
- `io/alpha-jwc/templates/outlines/alpha-jwc-7Cs-customized.yaml` — section 9 `recommendation_options: ["PASS", "CONSIDER", "COMMIT"]`
- `apps/memopop-orchestrator/AGENTS.md` — the operating contract for runtime agents; should be updated when the resolution lands here

## Open questions

- Is the right fix at the outline level (make recommendation optional / per-intent), the writer level (gate verdict-rendering on analyst signal), or both?
- Should the analyst be able to *pre-supply* the recommendation, and have the writer compose the closing prose around it? (Likely yes — this is the cleanest version of "analyst as decision-maker.")
- For `justify` mode where the firm has already invested, the recommendation is structurally always `COMMIT`. Is that the right default, or should `justify` mode also omit verdict-rendering entirely and let the analyst supply post-hoc framing?
- How should this interact with firm-level conventions? Some firms genuinely want an agent-rendered verdict as a draft starting point.
