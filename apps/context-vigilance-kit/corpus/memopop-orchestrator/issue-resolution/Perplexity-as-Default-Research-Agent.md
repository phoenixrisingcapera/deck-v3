# Perplexity API Fix - Zero Balance Issue

**Date:** 2025-11-21
**Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKER IDENTIFIED** - Requires action
**Issue:** API key has zero balance and is being blocked by Perplexity

---

## Problem Summary

Perplexity API requests are failing with Cloudflare 401 errors:
```
401 Authorization Required
openresty/1.27.4
```

We've had ongoing vacillation between `sonar-pro` being effectively used by the research agent with inclusion of citations and sources ON THE FIRST RUN. Why is this important?  Because the first run will create content, add facts, develop insights based on the web research of Perplexity. If the citations are not included on that first run, that means that a retrospective citation improvement process will be plugging in citations that may or may not be the original source.  Improving sections or enhancing citations is supposed to SUPPLEMENT the original research, not mask a bug we have for reasons we don't understand.

## Root Cause

According to [Perplexity API documentation](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/api-groups):

> **"API keys can only be generated when your balance is nonzero."**
>
> **"If you run out of credits, your API keys will be blocked until you add to your credit balance."**

Your API key exists (`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`) but has **zero credits**, so it's being rejected.

---

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Check Current Balance

1. Go to https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/group
2. Check your current credit balance (likely $0.00)

### Step 2: Add Credits

1. In Settings → API tab, click "**Add credits**"
2. Choose a credit amount to purchase (start with $5-$10)
3. Complete the payment

**Pricing Reference:**
- Sonar Pro: ~$0.50-$1.00 per 1,000 requests (varies by usage)
- For our memo generation: ~10 sections × $0.75 = ~$7.50 per memo

### Step 3: Verify API Key Works

After adding credits, run:
```bash
./test-perplexity-curl.sh
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "2 + 2 equals 4."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Alternative: Pro Subscription

If you have a **Perplexity Pro subscription** ($20/month):
- You receive **$5 in monthly API credits** on the 1st of each month
- Auto-renews monthly
- **Do NOT manually add credits** if you're a Pro subscriber - wait for the monthly credit
  - Manual add will charge you $5 even though Pro includes it

### To check if you have Pro:
1. Go to https://www.perplexity.ai/account
2. Look for "Pro" badge or subscription status

## What Happens After Adding Credits

Once you have a non-zero balance, the following will work:

### 1. Research Agent (Perplexity Provider)
```python
# src/agents/research_enhanced.py:92
model="sonar-pro"  # ✅ Will work
```

### 2. Citation Enrichment Agent
```python
# src/agents/citation_enrichment.py:121
model="sonar-pro"  # ✅ Will work
```

### 3. NEW: Section-Specific Research POC
```bash
python poc-perplexity-section-research.py  # ✅ Will work
```

---

## Testing Checklist

After adding credits:

- [ ] Run `./test-perplexity-curl.sh` → Should return valid JSON response
- [ ] Run `python test_perplexity.py` → Should print "SUCCESS"
- [ ] Run `python poc-perplexity-section-research.py` → Should generate Market Context research
- [ ] Generate a full memo with citations → Should work end-to-end

---

## Cost Estimates

Based on Perplexity Sonar Pro pricing:

| Operation | API Calls | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Full memo (current) | ~10 citations | ~$5-7 |
| Full memo (new POC) | ~10 section research | ~$7-10 |
| Section improvement | 1 section | ~$0.75 |
| General research | 4-5 queries | ~$2-3 |

**Recommendation:** Add $25-50 credits for testing and development.

---

## Next Steps

1. **ACTION REQUIRED:** Add credits to Perplexity API account
2. **Verify:** Run test scripts to confirm API access
3. **Resume:** Continue with POC testing (Perplexity research → Claude polish)
4. **Expand:** Roll out to all 10 sections if POC succeeds
