# Issue Resolution: Preventing Hallucinations in Memo Generation

**Date Started**: 2025-11-22
**Status**: Tier 1 COMPLETE, Tier 2 IMPLEMENTED (2026-03-23), Tier 3 IMPLEMENTED (2026-03-23)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: LLMs (including Perplexity Sonar Pro) fabricating pricing, traction, and business model data for seed-stage startups

---

## Problem Statement

**Expected Behavior:**
- When data is unavailable (pricing, revenue, metrics), agents should explicitly state "Data not available"
- LLMs should refuse to answer guiding questions that lack supporting evidence
- Perplexity Sonar Pro should admit when web sources don't contain requested information
- Fabricated claims should be caught and removed before final memo

**Actual Behavior:**
- Perplexity Sonar Pro is inventing pricing, business models, and traction data
- Even with web grounding, the system fabricates specific numbers for seed-stage startups
- Recent example: Invented ARR, pricing tiers, and customer counts for a pre-revenue company
- Hallucinations include:
  - Specific revenue figures ($X ARR) with no sources
  - Detailed pricing models that don't exist
  - Customer counts and growth rates pulled from thin air
  - Business model details contradicting reality

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Trust Destruction**: One fabricated number destroys credibility of entire memo
2. **Investment Risk**: Partners making decisions on false data
3. **Legal Liability**: Misrepresenting company metrics in investment documents
4. **Reputation Damage**: If founders see invented facts about their own company

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Discovery 1: Guiding Questions Create "Demand Pressure"

**Evidence from `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml`:**

**Business Overview Section (Lines 299-310):**
```yaml
guiding_questions:
  - "What does the company do? (in plain language, one sentence)"
  - "What specific problem are they solving for whom?"
  - "What is the business model? (how do they make money?)"
  - "Who pays and why? (customer value proposition)"
  - "What is the pricing strategy?"  # ← DEMANDS answer
  - "What are the unit economics? (CAC, LTV, gross margin if available)"  # ← "if available" is weak
  - "How do they acquire customers?"
```

**Traction & Milestones Section (Lines 517-526):**
```yaml
guiding_questions:
  - "What revenue has been generated? (ARR, MRR, or total with timeframe)"  # ← DEMANDS number
  - "How many customers do they have? (paying vs pilots)"  # ← DEMANDS count
  - "What is the customer growth rate? (MoM, YoY with %)"  # ← DEMANDS percentage
  - "Who are the marquee customers? (names/logos)"
  - "What are the usage metrics? (DAU, MAU, transactions, etc.)"
  - "What growth has been achieved? (specific % MoM or YoY)"  # ← DEMANDS specific %
```

**Funding & Terms Section (Lines 625-633):**
```yaml
guiding_questions:
  - "How much are they raising? (target and committed)"  # ← DEMANDS amount
  - "At what valuation? (pre-money or post-money - specify)"  # ← DEMANDS valuation
  - "What are the proposed terms? (equity stake, preferences, rights)"
  - "How will funds be used? (allocation breakdown)"
  - "What is the current runway? (months)"  # ← DEMANDS specific number
```

**The Psychological Problem:**

Questions are phrased as **interrogatives that demand answers**, not as optional information requests. The LLM interprets its task as "provide an answer to every question" rather than "answer questions where evidence exists."

---

### Discovery 2: Writer Agent Prompt Reinforces Answering Behavior

**Evidence from `src/agents/writer.py:388-412`:**

```python
user_prompt = f"""Write ONLY the "{section_def.name}" section for an investment memo about {company_name}.

SECTION GUIDANCE:
{section_def.description}

GUIDING QUESTIONS (Address these):  # ← "Address these" = COMMAND to answer
{questions_text}
{vocab_text}

RESEARCH DATA (summary):
{research_json}

Write ONLY this section's content (no section header, it will be added automatically).
Be specific, analytical, use metrics from research.  # ← "Be specific" + no data = fabrication
Target: {target_length} words (min: {section_def.target_length.min_words}, max: {section_def.target_length.max_words}).

SECTION CONTENT:
"""
```

**Analysis:**
- **"Address these"** creates obligation to answer every question
- **"Be specific, analytical, use metrics"** demands concrete details
- **Word count requirement** pressures LLM to fill space
- **No escape hatch** for "I don't have this data"

When the LLM faces:
- Question: "What revenue has been generated?"
- Research data: (no revenue mentioned)
- Instruction: "Address these" + "be specific" + "500 words"

It resolves the conflict by **inventing plausible-sounding data** rather than admitting absence.

---

### Discovery 3: Critical Rules Are Buried and Ineffective

**Evidence from `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml:543-551`:**

```yaml
section_vocabulary:
  critical_rules:
    - "NEVER use vague terms: 'significant traction', 'strong growth'"
    - "ALWAYS quantify: '$500K ARR', '50 customers', '30% MoM growth'"
    - "If metrics unavailable, state explicitly: 'Revenue data not available'"  # ← Good rule!
    - "Distinguish between pilots and paying customers"
    - "Distinguish between committed pipeline and closed deals"
```

**Why This Doesn't Work:**

1. **Conflicting directives**: Primary task says "Address these [revenue questions]" while buried rule says "state if unavailable"
2. **Prioritization**: LLMs prioritize main task completion over fine-print rules
3. **No enforcement**: Rules are suggestions, not constraints
4. **Passive voice**: "If metrics unavailable" is conditional, not imperative

**The rule SHOULD say:**
```
CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY:
You are FORBIDDEN from inventing revenue, pricing, or customer numbers.
If you cannot cite a source for a metric, you MUST write "Data not available."
Fabrication is grounds for immediate rejection. Honesty is required.
```

---

### Discovery 4: Even Perplexity Sonar Pro Hallucinates Under Pressure

**Why Web-Grounded LLMs Still Fabricate:**

Perplexity Sonar Pro searches the web first, THEN generates responses based on search results. But when:
- Search returns ZERO results for "Company X pricing"
- Prompt still asks "What is the pricing strategy?"
- Context includes "be specific, analytical"

Perplexity faces a choice:
1. **Admit absence**: "Pricing information not publicly available"
2. **Infer from context**: "Typical SaaS companies charge $X/user..." → Becomes "Company X charges $X/user"
3. **Fabricate plausibly**: "$99/month for basic, $299/month for pro" (sounds realistic)

**It often chooses #2 or #3** because:
- Task completion reward > epistemic honesty penalty
- Inference blurs into assertion
- No explicit "you may fail to answer" permission

---

### Discovery 5: No Fact-Checking Before Finalization

**Current Pipeline (from `src/workflow.py`):**

```
Writer → Trademark → Socials → Links → Viz → Citations → Validator → Finalize
                                                             ↑
                                                    Only checks "quality"
                                                    Not factual grounding
```

**Evidence from `src/agents/validator.py`:**

The validator checks:
- Section completeness
- Writing quality
- Tone and style
- Length targets

**The validator DOES NOT check:**
- Whether metrics have citations
- Whether claims are sourced
- Whether numbers appear in research data
- Whether specific facts are verifiable

**Result:** Fabricated claims pass validation as long as they're well-written.

---

## Three-Tier Defense System

### Tier 1: Prompt Engineering Fixes (Immediate - 80% Reduction)

#### Fix 1A: Reframe Question Directive in Writer Prompt

**Current (`src/agents/writer.py:397-398`):**
```python
GUIDING QUESTIONS (Address these):
{questions_text}
```

**Replace with:**
```python
GUIDING QUESTIONS (Only answer if you have evidence from research):
{questions_text}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ THIS CAREFULLY:
For EACH question above, you have THREE options:
1. ANSWER with specific data from research (preferred - cite sources)
2. STATE EXPLICITLY "Data not available" (acceptable - be honest)
3. OMIT the question entirely if not relevant (acceptable)

You are FORBIDDEN from:
- Inferring numbers from industry averages
- Speculating based on company stage or size
- Making up pricing, metrics, or financial figures
- Using phrases like "likely", "estimated", "typically", "around"

IF YOU CANNOT CITE A SOURCE FOR A SPECIFIC CLAIM, DO NOT MAKE THE CLAIM.
Investors prefer "Unknown" over guesses. Fabricated numbers destroy trust.

VALIDATION: Your output will be fact-checked. Any unsourced metric (revenue,
pricing, customer count, growth rate) will trigger automatic rejection and rewrite.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Explicit permission to NOT answer
- Three valid paths (answer/admit/omit)
- Negative consequences for fabrication
- Threat of rejection increases honesty

---

#### Fix 1B: Add Data Availability Preflight Check

**Insert BEFORE guiding questions in writer prompt:**

```python
DATA AVAILABILITY ASSESSMENT:
Before writing, review the research and mark each question below:

✓ = You have specific data from research to answer this
? = Partial data, can provide limited answer
✗ = No data available, will state "Data not available" or omit

Questions you mark ✗ should result in explicit "Data not available" statements
or be omitted from the section entirely. DO NOT invent data for ✗ questions.

Review the research data below and mentally mark each question before writing:
{questions_text}

NOW review the research:
{research_json}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Forces deliberate assessment BEFORE writing
- Creates cognitive separation between "what they're asking" and "what I can answer"
- Primes LLM to think about data availability
- Reduces automatic answering reflex

---

#### Fix 1C: Modify YAML Guiding Questions to Signal Optionality

**Current (`templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml`):**
```yaml
guiding_questions:
  - "What revenue has been generated? (ARR, MRR, or total with timeframe)"
  - "What is the pricing strategy?"
  - "What are the unit economics? (CAC, LTV, gross margin if available)"
```

**Replace with:**
```yaml
guiding_questions:
  - "What revenue has been generated? (ARR, MRR, or total - ONLY if you have a cited source. Otherwise state 'Revenue data not publicly available')"
  - "What is the pricing strategy? (ONLY if publicly disclosed or in pitch deck. If unknown, state 'Pricing not publicly available')"
  - "What are the unit economics? (CAC, LTV, gross margin - ONLY if you have actual data from sources. DO NOT estimate from industry averages)"
  - "How many customers do they have? (Exact number from sources ONLY. If unavailable, state 'Customer count not disclosed')"
```

**Template for high-risk questions:**
```
"[Question]? (ONLY if [source type]. Otherwise state '[Data type] not available')"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Embeds the escape hatch IN the question
- Provides exact phrase to use when data missing
- Signals that non-answer is acceptable
- Reduces question "demand pressure"

---

#### Fix 1D: Strengthen Critical Rules Placement

**Move critical rules from buried vocabulary to PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:**

**In `src/agents/writer.py`, add BEFORE guiding questions:**

```python
CRITICAL RULES - FAILURE TO FOLLOW = AUTOMATIC REJECTION:

1. NEVER FABRICATE METRICS
   - If you don't have revenue data, write "Revenue data not available"
   - If you don't have pricing, write "Pricing not publicly available"
   - If you don't have customer count, write "Customer count not disclosed"

2. CITE OR OMIT
   - Every specific number (revenue, customers, growth %) must have a source
   - If research doesn't mention a metric, DO NOT include it
   - "Estimated", "likely", "approximately" = fabrication in disguise

3. DISTINGUISH FACT FROM INFERENCE
   - Fact: "The company has 50 customers according to their blog post [^1]"
   - Inference: "As a seed-stage company, they likely have 20-50 customers"  ← FORBIDDEN

4. INDUSTRY AVERAGES ARE NOT DATA
   - "Typical SaaS companies charge $99/month" ≠ "This company charges $99/month"
   - Never use "typical", "standard", "usually" for THIS company's metrics

VALIDATION PROCESS:
After you write this section, it will be fact-checked. Every claim will be verified:
- Does this number appear in the research?
- Does this claim have a citation?
- Is this speculation disguised as fact?

Unsourced metrics trigger automatic section rejection and rewrite.
Honesty about data gaps is REQUIRED, not optional.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Prominent placement (impossible to miss)
- Threat of rejection (consequences)
- Specific examples of forbidden patterns
- Framing as "critical" not "guidelines"

---

### Tier 2: Fact-Checker Agent (Architecture Design)

#### Agent Purpose

Validate factual claims against research sources BEFORE final memo assembly. Identify:
- Unsourced metrics (revenue, pricing, customer count)
- Hallucinated names (customers, partners, investors)
- Speculative claims disguised as facts
- Numbers that don't appear in research data

#### Fact-Checker Workflow

```
Citation Enrichment → FACT CHECKER → Validator → Supervisor → Finalize
                            ↓
                      (if critical issues)
                            ↓
                    Trigger Section Rewrite
```

#### Implementation: `src/agents/fact_checker.py`

```python
"""
Fact Checker Agent - Verifies factual claims against research sources.

This agent identifies unsourced claims, hallucinated metrics, and speculative
statements. It flags sections for revision when fabrication is detected.

### Tier 3: Workflow Integration & Auto-Correction

#### Option A: Auto-Rewrite Flagged Sections

When fact-checker finds critical issues, automatically trigger `improve-section.py`:

```python
# In src/workflow.py after fact_checker_agent

def auto_correct_sections(state: MemoState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Auto-correct sections flagged by fact checker.

    Calls improve-section.py for each flagged section with
    strict "remove unsourced claims" instructions.
    """
    fact_check = state.get("fact_check_results", {})
    sections_to_fix = fact_check.get("sections_to_rewrite", [])

    if not sections_to_fix:
        return {"messages": ["No sections require correction"]}

    print(f"\n🔧 AUTO-CORRECTING {len(sections_to_fix)} SECTIONS")

    # For each section, call improve-section with special prompt
    for section in sections_to_fix:
        # Call improve-section.py with flag to remove unsourced claims
        # (Implementation depends on how you want to structure this)
        pass

    return {"messages": [f"Auto-corrected {len(sections_to_fix)} sections"]}
```

#### Option B: Human Review Queue

Route fact-check failures to human review before finalization:

```python
# In src/workflow.py supervisor node

def should_fact_check_pass(state: MemoState) -> str:
    """Route based on fact-check results."""
    fact_check = state.get("fact_check_results", {})

    if fact_check.get("overall_pass", False):
        return "validator"  # Continue to validation
    else:
        return "human_review"  # Route to human for manual fixes
```

#### Option C: Aggressive Claim Removal

Automatically strip unsourced claims from sections:

```python
def strip_unsourced_claims(section_content: str, fact_check_result: SectionFactCheck) -> str:
    """
    Remove sentences with critical/high severity unsourced claims.
    """
    claims_to_remove = [
        fc.claim
        for fc in fact_check_result.fact_check_results
        if fc.severity in ["critical", "high"] and fc.recommended_action == "remove"
    ]

    cleaned_content = section_content

    for claim in claims_to_remove:
        # Remove the claim sentence
        cleaned_content = cleaned_content.replace(claim, "")

    return cleaned_content
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Prompt Fixes (30 minutes)

**Priority: CRITICAL - Deploy ASAP**

1. **Modify `src/agents/writer.py`** (Lines 388-412)
   - Add critical rules section before guiding questions
   - Change "Address these" to "Only answer if you have evidence"
   - Add data availability preflight check
   - Add validation threat

2. **Test on problematic company**
   - Re-run memo generation for company that hallucinated
   - Compare before/after for fabricated claims
   - Measure reduction in unsourced metrics

**Expected Impact:** 60-80% reduction in hallucinations

---

### Phase 2: YAML Guiding Questions Rewrite (1-2 hours)

**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Update `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml`**
   - Rewrite all Traction & Milestones questions (Lines 517-526)
   - Rewrite all Funding & Terms questions (Lines 625-633)
   - Rewrite Business Overview questions (Lines 299-310)
   - Add explicit "state if unavailable" instructions

2. **Update `templates/outlines/fund-commitment.yaml`**
   - Apply same pattern to fund-specific questions

3. **Test with 3-5 different companies**
   - Vary data availability (public vs stealth)
   - Verify honest "data not available" responses

**Expected Impact:** Additional 10-15% reduction (cumulative: 70-90%)

---

### Phase 3: Fact-Checker Agent (2-3 hours)

**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Create `src/agents/fact_checker.py`**
   - Implement claim extraction logic
   - Implement verification logic
   - Add report generation

2. **Integrate into workflow**
   - Add node in `src/workflow.py`
   - Position after citation_enrichment
   - Route failures to human_review or auto_correct

3. **Add artifact saving**
   - Save to `5-fact-check.json` and `.md`
   - Include detailed claim-by-claim analysis

4. **Test validation**
   - Create test sections with known hallucinations
   - Verify fact-checker catches them
   - Tune detection thresholds

**Expected Impact:** Catch remaining 10-20% edge cases

---

### Phase 4: Auto-Correction Integration (2-4 hours)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

1. **Option A: Integrate with improve-section.py**
   - Add `--remove-unsourced` flag to improve-section.py
   - Auto-call for flagged sections

2. **Option B: Build claim-stripping function**
   - Automatically remove critical/high severity claims
   - Replace with "Data not available" statements

3. **Option C: Human review workflow**
   - Create review queue interface
   - Show flagged claims for manual approval/removal

**Expected Impact:** Full automation of fact-checking → correction loop

---

## Configuration & Tuning

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:
```bash
# Fact-checking strictness: low (40%), medium (60%), high (80%)
FACT_CHECK_STRICTNESS=high

# Auto-correction mode: manual, remove, improve
FACT_CHECK_AUTO_CORRECT=manual

# Enable/disable fact-checker agent
ENABLE_FACT_CHECKER=true
```

### Strictness Levels

| Level | Threshold | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **low** | 40% sourced | Exploratory memos, internal only |
| **medium** | 60% sourced | Partner review memos |
| **high** | 80% sourced | External-facing, final memos |

---

## Testing Protocol

### Test Case 1: Pre-Revenue Startup (High Risk)

**Company Profile:**
- Seed stage, pre-revenue
- No public pricing info
- Stealth mode (limited web presence)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Revenue section: "Revenue data not available"
- Pricing section: "Pricing not publicly disclosed"
- Customer count: "Customer count not disclosed" OR omitted

**Validation:**
- Zero fabricated dollar amounts
- Zero fabricated customer counts
- Zero fabricated growth percentages

---

### Test Case 2: Public Startup (Medium Risk)

**Company Profile:**
- Series A/B with press coverage
- Some metrics in TechCrunch/press releases
- Partial public info

**Expected Behavior:**
- Cited metrics from press: "According to TechCrunch [^1], $5M ARR"
- Unavailable metrics: "Growth rate not publicly disclosed"
- Mix of sourced claims and honest gaps

**Validation:**
- All specific numbers have citations
- Gaps acknowledged where data missing
- No inference from industry norms

---

### Test Case 3: Fund Commitment (Low Risk)

**Company Profile:**
- Established VC fund
- Public track record (DPI, TVPI, IRR)
- SEC filings, LP letters

**Expected Behavior:**
- Most metrics should be sourced
- Higher fact-check scores expected
- Fewer "data not available" statements

**Validation:**
- Performance data cited to SEC filings
- LP composition cited to sources
- Fee structure from fund docs

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals

| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Unsourced revenue claims | ~40% | <5% | Fact-checker detection rate |
| Unsourced pricing claims | ~30% | <5% | Fact-checker detection rate |
| "Data not available" usage | ~0% | 15-25% | Grep count in final memos |
| Overall fact-check score | ~50% | >80% | Fact-checker aggregate score |
| Hallucination incidents | 2-3/memo | 0/memo | Manual review + founder feedback |

### Qualitative Goals

1. **Founder Validation**: Founders should recognize their company's actual status
2. **Partner Trust**: Partners can rely on memo accuracy
3. **Legal Safety**: No misrepresentation of material facts
4. **Reputation Protection**: Memos can be shared externally without embarrassment

## Appendix: Example Transformations

### Before Fix: Hallucinated Traction

```markdown
## Traction & Milestones

The company has generated $2.5M in ARR with 150 paying customers
across enterprise and SMB segments. Growth has been strong at 35%
MoM, driven by product-led acquisition and strategic partnerships.

Key customer logos include Fortune 500 companies in financial
services and healthcare. The pricing model offers three tiers:
Basic ($99/month), Pro ($299/month), and Enterprise (custom pricing).

Customer acquisition cost is approximately $1,200 with an LTV of
$18,000, yielding a healthy 15:1 LTV:CAC ratio.
```

**Issues:**
- Fabricated ARR ($2.5M)
- Fabricated customer count (150)
- Fabricated growth rate (35% MoM)
- Fabricated pricing ($99, $299)
- Fabricated unit economics (CAC, LTV, ratio)

---

### After Fix: Honest Gaps

```markdown
## Traction & Milestones

**Current Status**: The company is in early customer validation with
paying pilots underway. Specific revenue and customer count data are
not publicly available at this stage.

**Product Milestones**:
- Q3 2024: Beta launch with initial design partners
- Q4 2024: First paying customers onboarded
- Q1 2025: Product v2.0 released with expanded feature set

**Customer Validation**: According to the founder's LinkedIn post [^5],
the company has "multiple enterprise design partners testing the platform."
Specific customer names and counts have not been disclosed.

**Pricing Strategy**: Pricing information is not publicly available.
The pitch deck indicates a planned SaaS model but does not specify tiers.
```

**Improvements:**
- Honest about data gaps
- Only cites what's verifiable
- Attributes soft claims to sources
- Focuses on what IS known (milestones, product status)

---

## Status Updates

**2025-11-22**: Initial diagnosis and solution design complete
**Next**: Implement Phase 1 prompt fixes and test
