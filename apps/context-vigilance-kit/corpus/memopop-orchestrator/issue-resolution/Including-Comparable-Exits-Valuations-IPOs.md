# Including Comparable Exits, Valuations, and IPOs

## Problem summary

The seventh and final C in Alpha Partners' / Alpha JWC's framework — **Cash on Cash Return Probability** — requires the memo to render bull/base/bear return scenarios with cash-on-cash multiples and to name comparable exits in the sector. The outline's `required_elements` for that section literally lists *"Comparable exits in sector with multiples"* and *"Exit paths with most likely acquirers or IPO thesis."* This is structurally the same kind of named-evidence requirement that the Category Leadership section has for competitors (see [[Competitive-Research-Generated-But-Not-In-Prose]]) — and it suffers from the same failure mode for the same architectural reason.

**There is no dedicated agent in the orchestrator that harvests comparable exits, IPOs, M&A outcomes, or secondary multiples.** The Cash on Cash section is left to surface this evidence through the codified section researcher's generic broad-search pass, which is the same path that the citation-fabrication problem comes from. The model "knows" that companies in the space have exited and renders plausible-sounding scenarios — but the named acquirers, the valuation multiples, the dates are exactly the kind of specific-numerical-claim slot that the model fills from training-data memory rather than from a tool call that retrieved real data.

The result, observed in `Panthalassa-Deck-Series-B/outputs/.../v0.0.2/2-sections/09-cash-on-cash-return-probability.md`: scenarios cite returns of *"3–8x"* and *"comparable maritime IPOs trading at 5–12x revenue"* without naming the comparable companies, listing the actual exit dates, or pointing to the underlying transactions. The prose reads correct; the evidence doesn't exist.

## Why this matters

Three reasons this gap is more than cosmetic:

1. **Scenarios are the document's load-bearing investment math.** The recommendation (PASS / CONSIDER / COMMIT — see [[Limiting-or-Omitting-Investor-Judgement]] for the related verdict-rendering issue) is supposed to derive from the probability-weighted return analysis. If the return analysis is anchored in unverifiable comps, the recommendation inherits that unreliability. The investment committee reading the memo can't sanity-check the conclusion against the evidence because the evidence is hand-wave.

2. **The exit-comp gap is more dangerous than the competitor-name gap.** For competitors, naming the wrong company is embarrassing but recoverable — the analyst spots it on read. For exit comps, citing the wrong valuation or the wrong acquirer at the right-sounding round of magnitude is plausible enough to slip past review. Wrong return scenarios → wrong recommendations → real capital misallocated.

3. **The space frequently lacks clean comps and that's not allowed to be the answer.** For categories like ocean energy where most prior companies haven't reached commercial exit (or have failed quietly), the *honest* answer is often *"the comp set is thin and tilts negative."* The current pipeline doesn't surface that honesty — it papers over it. A real comp-harvester should be willing to report `<comp-set-thin>` rather than fabricate.

## What "comps" means in this context

Distinguishing the types of comparables a memo needs is the first step in scoping the harvester:

| Comp type | What it shows | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct comps** | Same product/category exits (e.g., wave energy companies, marine renewable IPOs) | Cash on Cash; Category Leadership |
| **Adjacent comps** | Same buyer / same business model, different tech (e.g., offshore wind IPOs, floating solar M&A) | Cash on Cash; Colossal Market Size |
| **Analogous comps** | Same shape of risk/reward (e.g., hard-tech long-development-curve exits like Stoke Space, Climeworks; deep-ocean tech like Anduril marine) | Cash on Cash; Risks |
| **Counter-comps** | Failures and write-downs in the category | Risks; Diligence; honest Cash on Cash |
| **Multiple comps** | Public-market trading multiples for category-comparable companies | Cash on Cash (valuation anchor) |

Currently the pipeline implicitly treats all comps as the same — a generic "find me some comps" prompt — which is why adjacent-or-analogous-but-not-direct comps rarely surface, and counter-comps almost never do. A real comp-harvester should classify by type, surface all four positive types, and explicitly seek counter-comps as a separate retrieval pass.

## The data shape (proposed)

A comp record probably needs fields like:

```yaml
- company: <name>
  type: <direct | adjacent | analogous | counter>
  outcome: <ipo | acquisition | spac | secondary | write-down | shutdown>
  outcome_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  outcome_valuation_usd: <number>
  exit_multiple_revenue: <number | null>
  exit_multiple_paid_in: <number | null>  # cash-on-cash from last-round to exit
  acquirer: <name | null>
  sector_match: <"same-product" | "same-buyer" | "same-risk-shape" | "category-analog">
  why_relevant: <one to two sentences>
  source_urls: [<url>, <url>]              # MUST come from harvester tool calls, not LLM memory
  source_verdict: <"verified" | "thin" | "founder-asserted">
```

Source discipline matters here more than anywhere else in the pipeline, per the broader argument in [[Separating-Retrieval-from-Generation-in-Agent-Pipelines]]. A comp record without `verified` source URLs is a comp record that's probably hallucinated. The schema should make this hard to skip.

## Hypothesized fix shape

This is a feature gap. The eventual implementation probably composes:

1. **A new `comparable_exits_harvester` agent** structured the same way the competitive landscape evaluator is — discovery via search-tool calls (Crunchbase, PitchBook, CB Insights, SEC EDGAR for IPOs), validation, classification by comp type, body-grounded extraction of valuation/multiple fields. Saves to `outputs/<deal>-v0.0.N/1-comparable-exits.json` + `.md`.

2. **Wiring into the writer's section prompts.** Same plumbing problem as [[Competitive-Research-Generated-But-Not-In-Prose]]: the harvester's output has to reach `state["comparable_exits"]` and the writer's Cash on Cash, Colossal Market Size, and Risks section prompts have to inject it as structured context with explicit framing.

3. **Per-deal analyst input.** The analyst often knows the right comp set better than the agent (e.g., *"compare this to Stoke Space, not to oil-and-gas marine"*). Per-deal comp seeds should be supportable, probably via [[Per-Deal-Focal-Points]] or a sibling `inputs/comp-seeds.md`.

4. **Explicit `<comp-set-thin>` discipline.** When the harvester returns fewer than N validated direct+adjacent comps for the category, the writer should be required to surface that thinness in prose rather than inventing scenarios. Honest scarcity beats fabricated abundance.

5. **Cross-reference into the Risks section.** Counter-comps (failures, write-downs, stalled IPOs in the category) belong in Risks. The harvester should emit them as a distinct slice and the Risks section should consume them.

6. **Public-market multiples as a separate harvester step.** For categories with public comps (offshore wind, hard-tech IPOs), trading multiples from SEC filings or financial data providers are a different retrieval problem than M&A comps — different sources, different validation. Probably worth a second sub-agent.

## Where it surfaces in current code

- `src/agents/codified_section_researcher.py` — currently the only path that surfaces anything comp-like, via generic search. The hallucination surface lives here for now.
- `src/agents/writer.py` — drafts Cash on Cash section 9 from `1-research/09-cash-on-cash-return-probability-research.md`; has no comp-specific input.
- `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml` and firm descendants (`alpha-jwc-7Cs-customized.yaml`) — section 9 `required_elements` includes `"Comparable exits in sector with multiples"` and `"Exit paths with most likely acquirers or IPO thesis"`. The contract is right; the implementation can't honor it without a harvester.
- `src/agents/competitive_landscape_evaluator.py` — closest existing template; the comp-harvester should be modeled on its retrieval-then-classify-then-evaluate shape.
- `src/state.py` — needs a `comparable_exits: ComparableExitsData` field if this lands.

## Open questions

- Should the comp-harvester run per-deal once (results cached for re-runs), or per-version (fresh each time)? Comps don't change daily — caching with a TTL is probably right.
- Should it be allowed to fetch SEC EDGAR directly for IPO data, or rely on third-party aggregators (Crunchbase / PitchBook) that are paywalled but cleaner? Mixed approach probably correct.
- How does this interact with the firm-level outline customization? Some firms care more about M&A comps than IPO comps (or vice versa); should the comp-type weighting be firm-configurable in the outline YAML?
- For very early-stage companies (pre-Series-A) where the analyst's stage-aware fallback (per `alpha-jwc-7Cs-customized.yaml` notes) says "use category comps not company numbers," the comp-harvester is doing even more load-bearing work. Should there be a "stage-mode" that affects how aggressively the harvester is run?
- Should the harvester also surface *unsuccessful* outcomes (shutdowns, down-rounds, write-downs) by default, or only on explicit Risks-section requests?
