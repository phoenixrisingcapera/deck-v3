# Format Memo According to Outline Input

**Status**: In Progress - Phase 1 Complete
**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-21
**Author**: AI Labs Team
**Related**: Multi-Agent-Orchestration-for-Investment-Memo-Generation.md, Improving-Memo-Output.md

# Outstanding Issues
- [ ] Automated citation agent integration using Perplexity `sonar-pro` API
  - [ ] Make sure Perplexity AI requests to sonar-pro are working.  

## Executive Summary

This document specifies a refactoring initiative to move section definitions, guiding questions, and vocabulary from hardcoded markdown templates and agent logic into structured YAML **outline** files. This will enable:

1. **Dynamic section generation** based on investment type (direct/fund) and mode (consider/justify)
2. **Consistent but custom prompting** with firm-specific outlines guiding sections, topics, vocabulary and nomenclature, as well as questions per section accessible to all agents
3. **Vocabulary control** with industry-specific terms and preferred language embedded in each outline
4. **Easier outline maintenance** without modifying agent code
5. **Multi-outline support** for different firm styles or memo formats

**Terminology**: We use "outlines" for content structure (sections, questions, vocabulary) and "brand configs" for visual styling (colors, fonts, logos). This clear separation prevents confusion.

The system will maintain backward compatibility with existing templates while gradually migrating to YAML-based outlines.

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Default outlines created for both direct investment and fund commitment memo types.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Architecture Limitations

**Issue #1: Hardcoded Section Definitions**
- Section lists exist in multiple places:
  - `src/agents/writer.py:SECTION_ORDER` (hardcoded list)
  - `templates/<brand>_memo-template-direct.md` (markdown headers)
  - `templates/<brand>_memo-template-fund.md` (markdown headers)
      - `<brand>` is the brand name of the firm, e.g. "Hypernova"
- Adding a section requires editing 3+ files
- Section numbering must be manually synchronized
- No single source of truth for section structure

**Issue #2: No Centralized Guiding Questions**
- Writer agent has implicit knowledge of what each section should contain
- No structured guidance for what questions to answer per section
- Difficult to ensure consistency across memo generations
- New team members must reverse-engineer expectations from examples

**Issue #3: Vocabulary Scattered Across System**
- Style guide (`templates/style-guide.md`) contains general guidance
- Specific terminology preferences not codified
- No section-specific vocabulary control
- Agents may use inconsistent terminology

**Issue #4: Template Modifications Require Code Changes**
- Changing section order requires updating `SECTION_ORDER` constant
- Adding sections requires updating validation logic
- Renaming sections breaks file naming conventions
- Template changes coupled to agent logic

**Issue #5: No Mode-Specific Guidance**
- "Consider" vs "Justify" modes have different requirements
- Recommendation section should differ significantly by mode
- Currently handled implicitly in prompts, not declaratively

### Consequences

- **Maintenance burden**: Template changes require code changes
- **Inconsistency**: Different agents may interpret sections differently
- **Limited flexibility**: Cannot easily create custom memo formats
- **Poor documentation**: Section expectations not explicitly documented
- **Error-prone**: Manual synchronization between files leads to bugs

## Solution: YAML-Based Content Outlines

### Core Concept

Replace hardcoded section definitions with structured YAML **outline** files that define:
- Section metadata (name, number, filename)
- Guiding questions (what to address in this section)
- Vocabulary (preferred terms, phrases to use/avoid) **embedded in each outline**
- Mode-specific variations (consider vs justify)
- Validation criteria (what makes a good section)
- Default outlines run if no custom outline is specified

### Terminology Clarification

| Concept | Purpose | Location | Controls |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Outline** | Content structure | `templates/outlines/` | Sections, questions, vocabulary |
| **Brand Config** | Visual styling | `templates/brand-configs/` | Colors, fonts, logos, CSS |

This separation ensures "templates" refers only to visual styling, while "outlines" refers to content structure.

### Architecture Overview

```
templates/
├── brand-configs/          # VISUAL styling (already exists)
│   ├── brand-hypernova-config.yaml
│   ├── brand-collide-config.yaml
│   └── ...
│
└── outlines/               # CONTENT structure (NEW)
    ├── direct-investment.yaml       # Default for direct investments
    ├── fund-commitment.yaml         # Default for fund commitments
    ├── sections-schema.json         # Validation schema
    ├── README.md                    # Documentation
    │
    └── custom/                      # Firm-specific overrides
        ├── hypernova-direct-consider.yaml
        ├── hypernova-direct-justify.yaml
        └── ...
```

**Key Design Decision**: Vocabulary is **embedded within each outline**, not split into separate files. This makes outlines self-contained and easier to understand.

**Data Flow**:
1. User specifies investment type + mode (optionally custom outline)
2. System loads appropriate outline YAML (default or custom)
3. If custom, inherits from default and applies overrides
4. Agents receive structured guidance for each section (questions + vocabulary)
5. Writer agent generates sections following outline specifications
6. Validator checks against outline validation criteria

---

## YAML Schema Design

### Outline Definition Schema

**File**: `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml` ✅ **CREATED**

**Key Feature**: Vocabulary is embedded within the outline, not in separate files.

```yaml
# Direct Investment Memo Outline
# Default structure for evaluating startup/company investments

metadata:
  outline_type: "direct_investment"
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "10-section structure for evaluating direct startup investments"
  date_created: "2025-11-21"
  compatible_modes: ["consider", "justify"]

# Global vocabulary (applies to all sections) - EMBEDDED
vocabulary:
  financial:
    preferred:
      - term: "annual recurring revenue (ARR)"
        first_use: "annual recurring revenue (ARR)"
        subsequent: "ARR"
        definition: "Yearly value of recurring revenue contracts"
    avoid:
      - term: "revenue"
        instead: "Specify ARR, MRR, or total revenue"
        reason: "Ambiguous whether recurring or one-time"

  phrases_to_avoid:
    promotional:
      - phrase: "significant traction"
        reason: "Quantify with specific metrics"

  style_rules:
    tone: "Professional, analytical, balanced"
    citations: "Obsidian-style: [^1], [^2], [^3]"

# Section definitions
sections:
  - number: 1
    name: "Executive Summary"
    filename: "01-executive-summary.md"
    target_length:
      min_words: 150
      max_words: 250
      ideal_words: 200

    description: |
      Concise overview of the investment opportunity, synthesizing key findings
      from all other sections. Written last, read first.

    guiding_questions:
      - "What problem does this company solve?"
      - "What is the solution and how is it differentiated?"
      - "Who are the founders and what relevant experience do they have?"
      - "What traction has been achieved to date? (specific metrics)"
      - "What are the key risks and why are they manageable?"
      - "What is the investment recommendation (PASS/CONSIDER/COMMIT) and primary rationale?"

    # SECTION-SPECIFIC VOCABULARY (in addition to global vocabulary)
    section_vocabulary:
      preferred_terms:
        - "value proposition" (not "unique selling point")
        - "competitive advantage" (not "moat" unless technical context)
        - "go-to-market strategy" (not "GTM" on first use)
        - "traction" (not "progress" for metrics)

      required_elements:
        - Company name and brief description
        - Stage (Seed/Series A/B/C)
        - Specific traction metrics (ARR, customers, growth rate)
        - Clear recommendation with 1-sentence rationale

      avoid:
        - "revolutionary", "game-changing" (without evidence)
        - "significant traction", "strong team" (without specifics)
        - Undefined acronyms
        - "could potentially", "might be able to"

    mode_specific:
      consider:
        emphasis: "Objective assessment with balanced risk discussion"
        recommendation_options: ["PASS", "CONSIDER", "COMMIT"]
      justify:
        emphasis: "Clear rationale for why investment was made"
        recommendation_options: ["COMMIT"]

    validation_criteria:
      - "Length within target range (150-250 words)"
      - "Contains clear recommendation (PASS/CONSIDER/COMMIT)"
      - "Includes specific traction metrics (numbers, not adjectives)"
      - "Mentions founders by name with relevant credentials"
      - "Identifies 2-3 key risks"
      - "No promotional or speculative language"

  # ... (9 more sections with same structure) ...
```

See `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml` for the complete 10-section definition.

### Custom Outline Schema (with Inheritance)

**File**: `templates/outlines/custom/hypernova-direct-consider.yaml`

Custom outlines extend default outlines and override specific aspects:

```yaml
# Hypernova Capital - Direct Investment - Consider Mode

metadata:
  firm: "Hypernova Capital"
  investment_type: "direct"
  mode: "consider"
  extends: "../direct-investment.yaml"  # Inherits from default
  version: "1.0.0"

# Override/extend vocabulary (merged with base)
vocabulary:
  hypernova_preferred:
    - term: "founder-market fit"
      emphasis: "Critical for our thesis"

# Firm-specific philosophy
firm_preferences:
  tone: "Analytical, balanced, not promotional"
  critical_questions:
    - "Why this team?"
    - "Why now?"
    - "Why Hypernova?"

# Override specific sections
section_overrides:
  executive_summary:
    target_length:
      ideal_words: 175  # Shorter than default 200

  team:
    guiding_questions_add:
      - "Assess founder coachability"
    emphasis: "Founder-market fit is critical"

  risks_mitigations:
    minimum_risks: 7  # More than default 5
```

**Inheritance Flow**:
1. Load base outline (`direct-investment.yaml`)
2. Merge vocabulary (base + custom additions)
3. Apply section overrides (modify specific sections)
4. Result: Complete outline with firm customizations

---

## Removed: Separate Vocabulary Files

**Previous Design**: Vocabulary in separate `templates/vocabulary/*.yaml` files
**New Design**: Vocabulary embedded in each outline (self-contained)

**Rationale**:
- Simpler: One file to understand
- Self-contained: Outline has everything it needs
- Easier to customize: Firms can override vocabulary per outline
- No cross-file dependencies

---

## Examples from Existing Sections

The document previously showed all 10 sections in detail. For brevity, here are key examples:

### Business Overview Section
```yaml
  - number: 2
    name: "Business Overview"
    guiding_questions:
      - "What does the company do? (in plain language)"
      - "What specific problem are they solving?"
      - "What is the business model?"
      - "What are the unit economics?"

    section_vocabulary:
      preferred_terms:
        - "business model" (not "revenue model")
        - "customer acquisition cost (CAC)"
        - "product-market fit" (not "PMF" on first use)
```

**All 10 sections follow this pattern**. See the complete files for all sections:
- `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml` ✅ Created
- `templates/outlines/fund-commitment.yaml` ✅ Created

---

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Schema Design & Validation ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Created `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml` (complete with all 10 sections)
- ✅ Created `templates/outlines/fund-commitment.yaml` (all 10 sections)
- ✅ Created `templates/outlines/sections-schema.json` (JSON validation schema)
- ✅ Created `templates/outlines/README.md` (complete documentation)
- ✅ **Design Decision**: Embedded vocabulary in outlines (no separate vocabulary files)

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 2 default outline YAML files (direct, fund)
- ✅ 1 JSON schema for validation
- ✅ Complete documentation with examples
- ⏳ Unit tests for schema validation (pending)

---

### Phase 2: YAML Loader Utility ⏳ **NEXT**

**Objective**: Create utility module to load and merge YAML outlines

**Remaining Tasks**:
1. Create `src/outline_loader.py`
2. Implement loading functions:
   - `load_outline(investment_type: str) -> OutlineDefinition`
   - `load_custom_outline(name: str) -> OutlineDefinition`
   - Configuration merging logic (inheritance/overrides)
3. Create dataclasses in `src/schemas/`
4. Unit tests

### Phase 3: Writer Agent Integration ⏳ **PENDING**

Update writer agent to use outline guiding questions

### Phase 4: Validator Agent Integration ⏳ **PENDING**

Update validator to use outline validation criteria

### Phase 5: CLI & Configuration Selection ⏳ **PENDING**

Add `--outline` flag:
```bash
# Default outline
python -m src.main "Avalanche"

# Custom outline
python -m src.main "Avalanche" --outline hypernova-direct-consider
```

### Phases 6-8: Section Naming, Multi-Firm, Template Deprecation ⏳ **PENDING**

---

## Usage Examples (Post-Implementation)

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Default outline (uses direct-investment.yaml or fund-commitment.yaml)
python -m src.main "Avalanche"

# Custom firm outline
python -m src.main "Avalanche" --outline hypernova-direct-consider

# Specify in company data file
# data/Avalanche.json: {"outline": "hypernova-direct-consider", ...}
python -m src.main "Avalanche"
```

### Company Data File

Specify outline in `data/{CompanyName}.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "direct",
  "mode": "consider",
  "outline": "hypernova-direct-consider",  # Optional: use custom outline
  "description": "Company description..."
}
```

---

## How Agents Will Use Outlines

### Writer Agent
Loads outline and uses:
- **Guiding questions** to construct prompts for each section
- **Section vocabulary** to guide terminology
- **Target length** to constrain output
- **Mode-specific guidance** to adjust tone

### Validator Agent
Loads outline and uses:
- **Validation criteria** to check section quality
- **Length targets** to ensure appropriate sizing
- **Required elements** to verify completeness

## Vocabulary Configuration Schema

**REMOVED** - Vocabulary is now embedded in outlines

**Previous Design**:
```
templates/vocabulary/
├── investment-vocabulary.yaml
├── technical-vocabulary.yaml
└── style-preferences.yaml
```

**New Design**: Vocabulary embedded in each outline

---

### Memo Configuration Schema

**REMOVED** - Replaced by custom outlines with inheritance

**Previous Design**: Separate `templates/memo-configs/` directory
**New Design**: Custom outlines in `templates/outlines/custom/` that extend defaults

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Schema Design & Validation (Week 1-2) ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Create and validate YAML schemas for outlines

**Completed**:
- ✅ `templates/outlines/direct-investment.yaml` (complete with all 10 sections, vocabulary embedded)
- ✅ `templates/outlines/fund-commitment.yaml` (all 10 sections, vocabulary embedded)
- ✅ `templates/outlines/sections-schema.json` (validation schema)
- ✅ `templates/outlines/README.md` (documentation)

**Remaining**:
- ⏳ Unit tests for schema validation

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 2 complete outline files
- ✅ JSON validation schema
- ✅ Documentation
- ⏳ Unit tests (pending)

**Key Decision**: Embedded vocabulary in outlines instead of separate files. This simplifies architecture and makes outlines self-contained.

---

### Phase 2: YAML Loader Utility (Week 2-3) ⏳ **NEXT**

   - [ ] Include guiding questions, vocabulary, mode-specific guidance

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test prompt generation from outlines
   - [ ] Regression tests (quality maintained)

---

### Phases 4-8: Remaining Integration ⏳ **PENDING**

Summary of remaining phases:
- **Phase 4**: Validator agent integration
- **Phase 5**: CLI `--outline` flag
- **Phase 6**: YAML-defined section filenames
- **Phase 7**: Multi-firm support with custom outlines
- **Phase 8**: Deprecate old markdown templates

See original sections below for detailed task lists.

---

## Benefits of YAML-Based Outlines

### Clarity: "Outlines" vs "Templates"

**Before**: "Templates" meant both content structure AND visual styling (confusing!)
**After**:
- **Outlines** = content structure (sections, questions, vocabulary)
- **Brand configs** = visual styling (colors, fonts, logos)

### For Developers

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Content structure separate from agent logic
2. **Type Safety** - Dataclasses and schema validation
3. **Maintainability** - Single source of truth for sections
4. **Self-Contained** - Vocabulary embedded (no cross-file dependencies)

### For Users

1. **Consistency** - All agents use same section definitions
2. **Transparency** - Section expectations explicitly documented
3. **Flexibility** - Easy to customize for different firms
4. **Quality** - Guiding questions improve completeness

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Complete) ✅
- ✅ All 10 sections defined in YAML for both investment types
- ✅ Vocabulary embedded in outlines (no separate files)
- ✅ JSON schema for validation
- ✅ Complete documentation

### Remaining Must-Haves
- [ ] Outline loader module (`src/outline_loader.py`)
- [ ] Writer agent uses outlines
- [ ] Validator agent uses outline criteria
- [ ] CLI supports `--outline` flag
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
