# Triage Inbox with Suggestions

## Why (operator framing, 2026-07-25)

Triage is not just filing content — it is **indexing all the actors and
players in the space, peeling the onion toward a MECE knowledge graph**
(mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive: every real entity gets exactly
one canonical home, and the buckets jointly cover the space). Consequences
for triage judgment:

- **The actor matters even when the page is thin.** A 2KB homepage is weak
  *content*, but if it names a real player (TradesFutures, a state agency,
  an employer network), mint the org row and file it — the entity is the
  point, the page is just its first evidence.
- **Bucket questions are taxonomy questions.** When a capture fits no
  bucket (an operating provider, a nested initiative), that's a signal the
  MECE partition is incomplete — surface it as a decision, don't force-fit.
- **Relations complete the graph.** Pointer files, streams, and (pending)
  parent/child edges are how one fact serves multiple entities without
  breaking mutual exclusivity of the canonical home.

## The run playbook (distilled from the first co-pilot run)

Per batch of ~20 pending files: **scan → stamp → sweep → execute → log**.
The per-item decision sequence, in order:

1. **First-party check.** Is this the client's own content (reach-edu:
   reach.edu, healthapprenticeship.org)? → first-party home, registered on
   the client's own org row. Never propose a new bucket for the client's
   own programs.
2. **Duplicate check.** Same `exact_url` (or binary sha256) already
   captured or filed? → DEDUPE (archive the lesser capture; page-vs-PDF of
   the same artifact are NOT dupes — file both, Work-Trend-Index
   precedent).
3. **Stream check.** Rolling index page on a tracked org (topic hub, blog
   index, initiative hub)? → STREAM lane: `organization.streams.add`, then
   archive the capture.
4. **Fetch-health check.** 403/451/CAPTCHA/paywall stub? → GATED — unless
   the content is worth one ENRICH attempt now (Firecrawl recovers Forbes,
   AP, Substack-public; `pdftotext` for local PDFs; web-search to identify
   an unlabeled paper). A recovered wall-junk basename gets renamed to a
   real one.
5. **Destination.** Org-attributable → the org's role bucket (search
   BEFORE minting; enrich names immediately after any create) with
   `reference_of:` pointers fanned into relevant domain `sources/`.
   Topical → domain via `source.add` + canonical merge. Tool homepage →
   the tools topic. Profile page on an identity-link host → the org it
   profiles. Operator may rule "article only for now" (Deloitte, WEF) —
   file content to a domain, defer the org.
6. **Stamp DB-side identity into frontmatter** (`content_uuid`/`source_uuid`,
   `org_uuid`, `org_slug`), tags at filing time, `triaged_*` provenance,
   manifest row with every uuid.

**Calibration from run 1 (bands vs reality):** operator overrides were
almost never about *aboutness* — the suggestion engine's destination reads
held up — they were about *taxonomy* (new buckets minted mid-run: gated,
streams, gov-entities, think-tanks, associations-networks,
academic-institutions, data-services) and about *modeling* (parent/child,
entity vs content). Auto-band (≥0.90) discards were overridden once,
category-wide (discard→gated) — after which the corrected lane never
missed. Implication: the ≥0.90 band can graduate to batch-confirm groups
confidently; the human's attention belongs on new-entity and new-bucket
proposals.

### Reusable helpers (`scripts/` beside this SKILL.md)

- `nats-req.mjs <subject> <json> [timeoutMs]` — one-shot capability call
  over NATS (the whole wire runs through this).
- `stamp-suggestions.mjs <spec.json> <inbox-dir>` — insert
  `triage_suggestion:` blocks (skips already-stamped files).
- `merge-canonical.mjs <mapping.json> [client]` — inbox-file-is-canonical
  merge over a `source.add` stub: grafts registry keys, sets
  status/fetched, appends the Extracts skeleton, moves binaries.
- `org-move.mjs <mapping.json> [client]` — org-bucket filing: frontmatter
  stamp (content/org uuids, funder_slug/org_slug, triaged_*), binary
  sibling move, `reference_of:` pointer files.
- `org-tag.mjs <org-uuid> <client> <Tag...>` — has_tag observations with
  uuid-typed subjects (the direct-write stopgap; see the capability-gaps
  issue).

The inbox (per [[../../specs/Corpus-Inbox-Capture-and-Triage|Corpus-Inbox-Capture-and-Triage]])
promised "capture first, triage later." Capture shipped 2026-06-09; *later* is
now — reach-edu's inbox sits at **162 pending files** and the flat list broke
down at 86 (see [[../../explorations/Inbox-Sort-by-Agent-Tasks|Inbox-Sort-by-Agent-Tasks]],
whose taxonomy and confidence bands this skill operationalizes). The goal of a
triage run: **every item leaves `inbox/` for a core folder** — an existing one,
or a new one we create deliberately. Strive for a full drain; a residue of
genuinely-uncertain items staying `pending` is acceptable, forcing them is not.

## Ground truth (verified against code + disk, 2026-07-25)

- **Inbox files** live at `clients/<client>/corpus/inbox/<date>_<slug>.md` —
  real corpus markdown with the `captured_*` / `triaged_*` / `inbox_status`
  frontmatter blocks. Many have `tags: []` and empty `captured_note`.
- **Inbox items have NO SurrealDB row.** `corpus.inbox.add` writes the file
  only. The single-index belief holds for *filed* content — `source.add`
  mints a `source_uuid` (+ per-corpus `source_usages` rows) for domain
  corpora; `organization.corpus.add` / `person.corpus.add` mint
  `content_items` rows for org/person corpora — but the canonical uuid for an
  inbox item is **minted at triage time, by filing through a capability**.
  Never handcraft uuids or DB rows; the capability path also carries the
  `client` tag every canonical write requires.
- **Disk taxonomy** under `clients/<client>/corpus/`:
  - `funders/<org-slug>/` — corpora for organizations flagged as funders.
    (Canonically these are `organizations` in SurrealDB; *funder* is a role
    modifier, and not every collection-worthy org is one — a non-funder org
    destination means deciding where non-funder org corpora live: see Open
    decisions.)
  - `strategies/<slug>/sources/` — domain corpora; the folder name comes from
    the domain type (`strategy`→`strategies`, `topic`→`topics`,
    `thesis`→`theses`, `category`→`categories`,
    `market-segment`→`market-segments`). reach-edu's domains are strategies.
  - `gov-entities/<slug>/` — organizations clearly initiated by government,
    or government itself (state workforce offices, federal programs, …).
    Ruled 2026-07-25; same org-row + corpus-add wire as funders.
  - `think-tanks/<slug>/` — think tanks and research institutions (Brookings,
    Urban Institute, New America, …). Ruled 2026-07-25 in the same run. The
    non-funder-org question is resolving into role-named sibling buckets
    (funders / gov-entities / think-tanks) rather than one generic
    `organizations/` folder; DB org rows stay undifferentiated, disk
    placement carries the role.
  - `associations-networks/<slug>/` — membership associations AND networks
    (renamed from `associations/` 2026-07-25 when WEF was identified as a
    network — the bucket covers both) (BHEF,
    NAWDP, …). Ruled 2026-07-25 later in the same run; fourth role-named
    bucket. The org-attributable routing rule below applies to these too
    (BHEF's ED559688 report: canonical in `associations/bhef/`, pointer in
    workforce-development).
  - `academic-institutions/<slug>/` — university research centers and
    academic units (Project on Workforce at Harvard, …). Ruled 2026-07-25,
    fifth role bucket; same org-row-first + routing rules. These are also
    inherently NESTED (Project on Workforce ⊂ HKS ⊂ Harvard) — every filing
    here feeds the parent/child issue.
  - `data-services/<slug>/` — nonprofit data utilities (Credential Engine,
    …). Ruled 2026-07-25, sixth role bucket. Distinct from the
    grant-prospecting-tools TOPIC: the topic holds tool homepages as
    content; this bucket holds data-infrastructure orgs as actors.
    **Routing rule (ruled 2026-07-25):** think-tank reports/articles are often
    topical too — when content is attributable to a single think tank, the
    canonical file goes in the think tank's folder, and **pointer markdown
    files** (`reference_of:` frontmatter) fan into every relevant domain's
    `sources/` folder (`topics/<slug>/sources/`,
    `strategies/<slug>/sources/`). Pointers are disk-only — no `source.add`
    row is minted for them (that would double-register the content); the
    double-count caution in Open decisions applies.
  - `inbox/` — the queue this skill drains.
  - `_discarded/` — created on first discard; plain visible folder, never
    dot-prefixed, never hard-delete.
  - `AGENTS.md` at the corpus root — read it at session start; it is the
    corpus's own operating guidance.

## The destination model

Each pending item gets **one primary home** plus optional reference copies:

1. **Primary home** — a funder org folder, a person, or a domain
   (thesis/strategy/topic/…). Filing goes **through the capability wire** so
   the canonical index row exists first: `source.add` (domains, resolves
   `(domain_type, domain_slug)` against the live `domain.list` — never
   fabricate a slug, per the [[../inbox-curation/SKILL|inbox-curation]]
   decision tree), `organization.corpus.add` (org/funder),
   `person.corpus.add` (person).
2. **Reference copies** — once the canonical uuid exists, the markdown is
   cheap to replicate into *any other* folder where agents will later work,
   so deliverable-generation can stay inside one folder without hunting
   stragglers. Every reference copy MUST declare itself in frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   reference_of: "<canonical uuid (source_uuid or content_items id)>"
   canonical_path: "corpus/strategies/workforce-development/sources/2026-06-09_….md"
   reference_note: "replicated here because <one line>"
   ```

   The `reference_of` key is the loop-safety contract: anything scanning a
   folder dedupes by it, and coverage/count surfaces must learn to skip it
   (see Open decisions — double-count risk).
3. **Sweeping / hard-to-classify content** gets an *abstract* home, not a
   forced org: propose a `topic` (or `category`) domain via `domain.create`
   — always `chat_propose`-grade (creating a corpus is a visible,
   workspace-wide decision), never silent — and file there. Examples from
   the live inbox: cross-funder sector reports, Work-Trend-Index-style
   industry PDFs, regulatory documents.
4. **Identity-link hosts** (ruled 2026-07-25): Cause IQ, Charity Navigator,
   GrantForward, Grant Bay — Crunchbase-like profile databases (roster also
   effectively includes projects.propublica.org, instrumentl.com,
   fconline.foundationcenter.org, grantable.co-style prospect pages seen in
   funder folders). Routing: a *profile page* on one of these is a profile
   OF an org → file it to the org it's about (these should eventually be
   smartly handled by the UI as org identity links); the tool's own
   homepage / content marketing → a topic (first instance:
   `topics/grant-prospecting-tools/`, created this run).

## The suggestion pass (the scanning half)

For each `inbox_status: pending` file, read the cheap signals — `title`,
`exact_url` host, `published_at`, `captured_note`, first ~500 chars of body,
`binary_asset` presence — and match against three rosters loaded once per
run: the funder/org roster (slugs + known domains), the live `domain.list`,
and the harvested tag roster. Stamp the result into the file as the
`triage_suggestion:` block (schema per
[[../../explorations/Inbox-Sort-by-Agent-Tasks|Inbox-Sort-by-Agent-Tasks]] —
action, proposed destination, confidence 0–1, one-line rationale, signals
used). The block is a **proposal**; the operator's sweep decides.

Confidence bands govern the sweep affordance:

| Band | Confidence | Sweep shape |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-routable | ≥ 0.90 | Presented as a batch list; one operator yes files the whole batch |
| Suggested | 0.60–0.89 | Per-item confirm ("looks like X — yes / different / skip") |
| Uncertain | < 0.60 | Operator decides unaided; agent stays quiet |

Co-pilot phase rule: **no auto-apply, ever, without an operator sweep** —
even the ≥0.90 band files only after a batch yes. Downgrade this friction
only after calibration data exists (operator override rate per band).

## Task lanes

Every file maps to exactly one lane (taxonomy from the exploration):

- **TRIAGE** — destination is clear or suggestible. The main lane.
- **EXTRACT** — PDFs/binaries with empty bodies: run extraction before
  classification, or classify from title+URL alone with a confidence
  penalty and note `body_unextracted: true` in the suggestion.
- **ENRICH** — stub captures needing more context; agent may fetch linked
  pages, human picks.
- **DEDUPE** — `exact_url` (or binary sha256) already exists in
  `content_items` / `sources` or in a filed folder: propose merge-or-skip,
  never file a duplicate.
- **FLAG** — high-signal, operator wants it surfaced but not filed yet;
  stays pending with the flag noted.
- **STREAM** *(ruling, first co-pilot run 2026-07-25)* — a capture that is a
  *rolling index page* on a tracked org's site (a topic hub, blog index,
  issues page — Brookings' /topics/artificial-intelligence/, New America's
  /issues/education-and-work/) is not corpus content and not a discard: it's
  a **pulse stream**. Propose `organization.streams.add {org_slug, url,
  kind, name, client}` on the org, then archive the capture file to
  `_discarded/` with a superseded-by-stream note. The stream keeps pulsing;
  a one-time capture of it is worthless. Known `kind` vocabulary (grows by
  operator precedent):
  - `topic_stream` — a topic/issues hub (Brookings AI, New America
    Education & Work)
  - `blog_index` — an org's blog/news index (BHEF Blog)
  - `initiative_hub` — the hub page of a named org *initiative* — a program
    with its own rolling identity inside the org (AEI's Workforce Futures
    Initiative on `american-enterprise-institute`, added 2026-07-25). Also
    the lightweight answer for initiative-shaped pages while the
    parent-child org model is unresolved: a hub can be a stream on the
    parent org without minting a child org.
- **GATED** *(ruling, first co-pilot run 2026-07-25)* — fetch-blocked
  captures (403 "Access Denied", CAPTCHA/"Just a moment" walls, paywall
  stubs) are NOT discards: the URL is still wanted, only the fetch failed.
  Move to `inbox/gated/` (plain visible folder), `inbox_status: "gated"`.
  They stay parked for a later re-fetch attempt via a different fetcher;
  a gated item whose URL later lands successfully becomes purgeable.
- **DISCARD** — genuinely worthless captures: 404 bodies, consent
  boilerplate, empty nav/index pages, `content_length_bytes` tiny with
  nothing behind it. Move to `corpus/_discarded/` (archive, no delete),
  `inbox_status: "discarded"`. Fetch-blocked pages go to GATED, not here.

Drain order: auto-routable TRIAGE first, then suggested TRIAGE, EXTRACT,
DEDUPE, DISCARD, then the uncertain residue. Easy buckets first; the human's
attention goes to the hard tail.

## Mechanics of one filing

1. File through the capability → canonical uuid + client tag exist.
2. Place the markdown in the primary home; populate the `triaged_*` block
   (`triaged_by: "operator-confirmed:triage-inbox-w-suggestions"` when the
   operator confirmed an agent proposal — provenance matters) and flip
   `inbox_status: "triaged"`. Keep the `captured_*` block untouched forever.
3. Write any reference copies with their `reference_of` frontmatter.
4. Tags (see below) go on at filing time, not before.
5. Never clobber anything a human already filed — filing is additive;
   collisions become DEDUPE decisions.

## Tagging convention

- YAML inline array of quoted strings: `tags: ["Workforce-Development", "State-of-the-Industry", "Future-of-Work"]`
- Casing is title-like with dashes: each substantive word capitalized,
  **connector/minor words lowercase** ("of", "the", "on", "an", "and"),
  acronyms uppercase (`"HNWI"`, `"AI-in-K-12"`). Not ALLCAPS; not
  every-word Train-Case.
- **Prefer an existing tag over minting a new one.** Harvest the roster at
  run start (grep `tags:` across the client's corpus + the domain sources'
  tags) and match against it; new tags need a reason a roster tag can't
  serve.

## Batch rhythm & resumability

- Work in batches of ~15–25 files; each batch = scan → stamp suggestions →
  operator sweep → file → log.
- Keep a run manifest at `clients/<client>/corpus/inbox/_triage-runs/<date>_<n>.md`
  (plain visible folder): one line per file — decision, destination, uuid,
  band, who decided. This is what makes a cleared-context session resumable
  and the calibration data for loosening the bands later.
- Idempotence: only `inbox_status: "pending"` files are in scope; a re-run
  after an interrupted session picks up exactly where the manifest stopped.

## Never

- Hard-delete anything (discard = archive to `_discarded/`).
- Fabricate a domain slug, org slug, or uuid — resolve against live rosters.
- File a canonical write without the `client` tag (the capability wire does
  this for you; another reason not to bypass it).
- Dot-prefix a folder meant for human review.
- Force the last uncertain items just to hit 100% — pending is an honest
  state.

## Open decisions (co-pilot phase resolves these; record rulings in place)

- [x] ~~The mechanics fork~~ — RESOLVED: inbox file is canonical; see the
      ruling block in "Mechanics of one filing".
- [x] ~~Discard vs fetch-blocked~~ — RESOLVED: GATED lane added; blocked
      fetches park in `inbox/gated/`, discards are for genuinely worthless
      content only.
- [x] **Government entities** (ruled 2026-07-25): entities clearly initiated
      by government, or government itself, get `corpus/gov-entities/<slug>/`
      — clients (reach-edu certainly) want to track all kinds of
      government-related entities. Same filing wire as funders (org row via
      `resolver.apply action:create`, then `organization.corpus.add`, then
      move the file); disk placement carries the gov distinction, DB-side
      flagging is a follow-up. First filing: accelerate-ms.
- [ ] **Non-funder, non-government organizations**: orgs worth collecting on
      that are neither funders nor gov-initiated (membership forums like
      BHEF, professional associations like NAWDP, employer networks like
      Human Potential Network) — sibling folder
      (`corpus/organizations/<slug>/`?) or something else? Still open;
      captures accumulate pending in the inbox.
- [x] **Parent-child organizations** — MODEL LANDED (2026-07-27): org↔org
      relations are live (`organization.relate` / `.relations` /
      `.unrelate` / `.relation.update` — parent/child/peer + kind +
      free-text description, edges in the `affiliations` table) along with
      org tags (`organization.tag.add` / `.remove` — Initiative, Program,
      Fund…). Per
      [[../../plans/Org-Relations-Parent-Child-Peer-Plus-Org-Tags|the plan]];
      history in
      [[../../issues/Parent-Child-Nested-Organizations-Not-Modeled|Parent-Child-Nested-Organizations-Not-Modeled]].
      **Aboutness routing (step 5b):** when a destination org has relations
      or the page names an initiative/fund/program of a parent, ask which
      entity the content is *about* before filing — parent content on the
      parent, initiative content on the child, `reference_of:` pointer
      across the seam when both want it. An initiative that is a real actor
      but has no row yet → mint the child, relate it (`rel: parent`,
      `kind: initiative_of`), tag it `Initiative`, and file there.
      The parked upmobility/urban-institute captures are the pilot filing
      (issue's worklist section A).
- [x] **Person-destined content** (ruled 2026-07-27): individual funders
      keep normal `funders/<slug>/` folders (the funders corpus is the
      funder-to-strategy mapping substrate); DB identity is a **persons**
      row affiliated to their org(s); folder files carry `person_uuid` +
      `person_name` + `entity_kind: "person"` frontmatter. Also ruled: the
      DB slug is the source of truth for folder names — rename folders, not
      rows (welded parent/child slugs excepted, parked on that issue).
- [ ] **Reference-copy double-counting**: coverage lenses and
      `corpus.list_for_record` walk the filesystem; teach them to skip
      `reference_of:` files before fanning references widely.
- [ ] When (if ever) the ≥0.90 band graduates from batch-confirm to
      auto-apply-with-undo.

## Agent-chat availability (since 2026-07-25)

A condensed operational form of this skill ships in didi's chat as the
**ACTIVE_SKILLS slab** in `services/workspace/src/chat.ts` (the Slab-3 spot
reserved since v0.0.1), teaching the triage verbs
(`organization.corpus.add`, `resolver.search`, `resolver.apply`,
`resolver.update_org`, `organization.streams.add` — and, since 2026-07-27,
the relations/tags verbs `organization.relations`, `organization.relate`,
`organization.tag.add` with the step-5b aboutness routing) and the decision
sequence above. Honest limit: chat-didi can register, resolve, mint, and
stream — the *disk* half of a filing (canonical merge, pointer files,
binary moves) still runs session-side via the scripts above, until a
`corpus.triage.apply` capability exists. This SKILL.md remains the source
of truth; the slab is its condensation — update both together.
