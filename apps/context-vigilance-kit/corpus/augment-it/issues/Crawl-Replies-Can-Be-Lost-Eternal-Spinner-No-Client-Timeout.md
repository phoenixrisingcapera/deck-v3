# Crawl replies can be lost

## The incident (2026-07-24 evening, logs-confirmed)

Operator fires a links crawl on The Beth & Ravenel Curry Foundation → UI
stuck on "crawling…". prompt-runner logs show the truth: `crawl completed
… ms: 87542`. The work succeeded; the reply never made it back. Earlier
team crawls (Quell 211s, Truist 147s) completed too — 211s uncomfortably
close to the 300s dispatch ceiling.

## The three stacked gaps

1. **No client-side deadline.** `workspace.invoke` waits forever; a lost
   reply is an eternal spinner with a disabled button.
2. **WS reconnects drop pending invokes.** The transport reconnects with
   backoff, but in-flight invokes don't survive the new socket — and
   workspace-service container rebuilds (three today) sever every session.
   Any crawl pending across one is orphaned.
3. **300s dispatch ceiling vs multi-minute crawls.** The NATS
   request timeout was set before live team-crawl timings existed.

## Shipped mitigations

- 660s `withDeadline` race on `crawlSearch` and `crawlTeam` — the spinner
  always resolves; the error names that the run may still have finished
  server-side and to re-fire.
- `organization.crawl` dispatch ceiling 300s → 600s (pack.fan_out's
  precedent).

## Remaining (folded elsewhere)

- Transport-level invoke re-correlation across reconnects (or
  server-held results claimable by request id) → the liveness sweep (#21).
- Crawl progress frames (#35) would surface a dead reply path within
  seconds instead of minutes.
