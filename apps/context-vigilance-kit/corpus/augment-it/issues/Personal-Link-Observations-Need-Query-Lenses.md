# Personal-link observations need named query lenses

## Context

The [[Sparse-Person-Enrichment-Surface]] v0.0.0.1 adds a PersonalLinks
pulse-dimension that writes one observation per captured URL with
predicate `has_personal_link` and qualifiers carrying `kind`, `title`,
`url_domain`, and (when matched) `org_id`. Schema:

```sql
CREATE observations SET
  subject     = persons:<X>,
  predicate   = "has_personal_link",
  object      = "https://philanthropyroundtable.org/team/stephen-allison/",
  observed_at = time::now(),
  source      = "person-enrichment",
  qualifiers  = {
    kind:       "team_page",
    title:      "Stephen Allison · The Philanthropy Roundtable",
    url_domain: "philanthropyroundtable.org",
    org_id:     organizations:<phil-roundtable>
  },
  client      = "reach-edu";
```

That shape is the canonical fact log. The querying lenses aren't built.

## The queries we anticipate

Captured here so they're discoverable when someone hits the friction.

### Per-person presence rollup

> "Show me everywhere we've found Stephen on the public web."

```sql
SELECT object AS url, qualifiers.kind AS kind, qualifiers.title AS title, observed_at
  FROM observations
  WHERE subject = persons:<X> AND predicate = "has_personal_link"
  ORDER BY observed_at DESC;
```

Useful for: prep before a meeting, generating a credibility card,
seeding a briefing doc.

### Per-org corpus rollup (lens onto Funder-Content-Corpus)

> "Show me all the blog posts, publications, and press releases on
> philanthropyroundtable.org we've captured, regardless of which
> person we captured them through."

```sql
SELECT object AS url, subject AS author, qualifiers.kind, qualifiers.title, observed_at
  FROM observations
  WHERE predicate = "has_personal_link"
    AND qualifiers.url_domain = "philanthropyroundtable.org"
    AND qualifiers.kind IN ["blog_post", "publication", "press_release", "research_report"]
  ORDER BY observed_at DESC;
```

Useful for: the Funder-Content-Corpus lens — the same data we'd
otherwise have to crawl the funder's site for. The PersonalLinks
dimension is the operator-curated path into corpus; the cron crawler is
the automated path. They write the same predicate; this query reads
both.

### Kind-filtered slice across the whole canonical layer

> "Show me everyone we know who's been on a podcast (any podcast)."

```sql
SELECT subject AS person, object AS url, qualifiers.title, observed_at
  FROM observations
  WHERE predicate = "has_personal_link"
    AND qualifiers.kind = "podcast"
    AND client_access CONTAINS $workspace_slug
  ORDER BY observed_at DESC;
```

(The client_access filter applies via the subject person — handled by
materialization or join.)

Useful for: "who'd be a good guest for our event," "who has thought
leadership on X."

### Team-page-only lens (the "first instance" relationship)

> "For each known org, which of our people appears on their team page?"

```sql
SELECT subject AS person, qualifiers.org_id AS org, object AS url, observed_at
  FROM observations
  WHERE predicate = "has_personal_link"
    AND qualifiers.kind = "team_page"
    AND qualifiers.org_id IS NOT NONE
    AND client_access CONTAINS $workspace_slug;
```

Useful for: the operator's "do we actually know an insider at this org"
question — distinct from a vendor relationship or an alumni connection.

## What we should index for these to stay fast

At ≤30K entities and the redundancy ethos, indexes are cheap. Adding
these when the friction arrives:

```sql
DEFINE INDEX personal_link_kind   ON observations FIELDS predicate, qualifiers.kind;
DEFINE INDEX personal_link_domain ON observations FIELDS predicate, qualifiers.url_domain;
DEFINE INDEX personal_link_org    ON observations FIELDS predicate, qualifiers.org_id;
```

Not adding them now — premature indexing is a real cost in clarity, and
the lenses aren't built yet. Add when one is slow.

## Resolution path

This isn't a bug to fix — it's a flagged future-state. Resolution = when
an operator workflow hits one of the listed lenses, we either:

1. Ship the query as a SurrealQL function (`DEFINE FUNCTION
   fn::presence_for_person($id)`) — fast, reusable, cacheable.
2. Ship the query inside the pulse-surface's read path (e.g. show
   existing personal-links above the input form so the operator sees
   what's already captured for this person).
3. Ship a new lens surface that takes a query intent and renders the
   results.

Default to (1) + (2). (3) is a real undertaking and only justifies
itself when ≥3 lenses are in active use.
