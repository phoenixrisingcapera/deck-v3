title: 'One stuck message kills a NATS subject until restart — `domain.list: timeout`
  and the sequential handler loop'
lede: Every handler in `domains.ts` consumes its subject with a `for await` loop,

# One stuck message kills a NATS subject until restart

## Why Care?

The operator saw `domain.list: timeout` and reasonably concluded that reach-edu's
corpora had failed to load. They had not. All nine were in SurrealDB the whole
time, reachable in about a second. What had failed was the *service's ability to
answer any question on that subject at all* — for every client, including an
empty filter.

This is the worst shape a failure can take in this stack: **silent, total for the
affected subject, and invisible in the logs.** The container reports healthy, the
NATS subscription stays registered, the process never crashes, and nothing is
written to stdout. The only signal is that replies stop coming, and the only
recovery is a restart.

It will recur. The conditions that cause it are ordinary.

## Symptom

```
❯ domain.list: timeout
```

Corpora absent from the reach-edu workspace. Every other surface behaving
normally.

## What it was not

Ruled out by measurement, in this order:

| Suspected | Verdict |
|---|---|
| reach-edu's data missing | **No.** All 9 domains present in SurrealDB |
| Client-specific | **No.** `{}`, `reach-edu` and `humain-vc` all timed out |
| The `registerHandlers` rename shipped the same week | **No.** `domain.list.requested` is registered by `registerDomainHandlers` in `domains.ts`, untouched by that commit |
| Service not running / crashed | **No.** Container up, `RestartCount=0`, booted clean |
| SurrealDB unreachable from the container | **No.** DNS + TLS OK; full connect → signin → use → query in **1,107ms** |
| The full-table `UPDATE` in `ensureDomainSchema` | **No.** Measured **538ms** across 210 `sources` and 254 `source_usages` |
| Nothing subscribed to the subject | **No.** A misread of the NATS monitoring payload — `subs_detail` is empty, the real key is `subscriptions_list_detail`, and the subject *was* registered |

## The evidence that located it

NATS monitoring, before and after a single probe request:

```
BEFORE: in_msgs=4 out_msgs=15
PROBE:  timeout
AFTER:  in_msgs=4 out_msgs=16
```

`out_msgs` incremented — the server **delivered** the message to the resolver
connection. `in_msgs` did not — the service **replied with nothing**. The message
arrived, was consumed, and produced no response and no log line.

A `docker restart` of the service restored it immediately: first call 1,952ms
cold, second 118ms, all 9 domains returned.

## Root cause

Every handler in `services/record-surrealdb-resolver/src/domains.ts` is
registered through this shape:

```ts
void (async () => {
  const sub = nc.subscribe(subject);
  for await (const msg of sub) {
    const args = msg.json() as T;        // ← OUTSIDE the try
    try {
      const db = await getDb();          // ← no timeout
      await ensureDomainSchema(db);
      const result = await fn(db, args);
      if (msg.reply) msg.respond(JSON.stringify({ ok: true, ...(result as object) }));
    } catch (err: unknown) {
      if (msg.reply) msg.respond(JSON.stringify({ ok: false, error: String(err) }));
    }
  }
})();
```

Three defects compound into the observed behaviour.

### 1. `for await` is strictly sequential — one stuck message blocks the subject

The loop awaits each message's full processing before pulling the next. A single
request that never settles halts the queue **permanently**. Later requests are
delivered by NATS and then dropped on the floor. Nothing times the loop out,
nothing retries it, nothing reports it.

### 2. `getDb()` has no timeout and caches only on success

```ts
export async function getDb(): Promise<Surreal> {
  if (db) return db;
  const instance = new Surreal();
  await instance.connect(URL);       // ← can hang indefinitely
  await signinAndUse(instance);
  db = instance;                     // ← only reached on success
  return db;
}
```

`connect()` against a WSS endpoint (Surreal Cloud) has no deadline. If the
handshake stalls — a transient network blip at container start is enough — the
promise never settles, `db` is never assigned, and combined with defect 1 the
subject is dead for the lifetime of the process.

### 3. `msg.json()` sits outside the try block

A malformed payload throws out of the `for await` loop entirely. Because the
loop lives in a bare `void (async () => {})()` with no `.catch()`, that becomes
an unhandled rejection and the subscription's consumer is gone — silently. The
NATS subscription stays registered server-side, so the subject *looks* healthy
from monitoring while nothing consumes it.

## Blast radius

`domains.ts`'s `handle()` covers `domain.list.requested`,
`domain.assemble.requested` and `tag.suggest.requested`, plus the hand-written
loops for `domain.create.requested` and `domain.retype.requested`. The same
`void (async () => { for await ... })()` idiom appears across the other NATS
services, so this is a **pattern-level** defect rather than a single-file one —
`domains.ts` is simply where it fired first, being the busiest cold-start path.

## Fix

1. **Bound `getDb()`.** A connect/signin deadline that rejects rather than hangs,
   so the `catch` can answer `{ok:false}` and the loop moves on.
2. **Move `msg.json()` inside the try**, so a malformed payload answers with an
   error instead of destroying the subscription.
3. **Stop one message blocking the queue.** Process each message without awaiting
   it in the loop body, so a slow or stuck request cannot starve the others.
4. **Never let the consumer die silently.** Attach a `.catch()` to the loop that
   logs, so if it ever does exit there is a line in the logs instead of silence.

## Verification — done 2026-08-08

**Unit** — 9 new tests in `test/nats-loop.test.ts`, covering each defect against
a fake subscription with no broker and no database. The production bug was
unreachable from the existing suite precisely because every test went through a
real SurrealDB and none exercised the loop.

**Live, against the running stack** after rebuilding the container:

```
domain.list reach-edu        1857ms  ok=true  domains=9
   upward-mobility, grant-prospecting-tools, future-of-work,
   workforce-development, frontier-job-demand, agent-workflow-maxxing,
   adult-literacy-numeracy, ncad-forge, rural-income-boosts
domain.list humain-vc         111ms  ok=true  domains=7
domain.list (no filter)       161ms  ok=true  domains=16

malformed payload               3ms  ok=false  "not json{{" is not valid JSON
domain.list reach-edu (after) 112ms  ok=true  domains=9   ← SUBJECT SURVIVED
```

That second block is the regression itself: under the old code the malformed
payload threw out of the `for await` and every later request on the subject was
dropped. It now answers in 3ms and the subject keeps serving.

**Suite** — 87 tests across 7 suites, all passing (`bash scripts/test-all.sh`).

## What was NOT fixed here

Only `record-surrealdb-resolver` was changed. The same
`void (async () => { for await ... })()` idiom appears across the other NATS
services, and `nats-loop.ts` was deliberately written to be liftable — it takes
any `AsyncIterable` of reply-shaped messages and has no dependency on this
service. Rolling it out is tracked separately.

Within this service, the ten consumers landed in two states. The five paths
that route through `serveSubject` (`domain.list`, `domain.assemble`,
`tag.suggest`, `domain.create`, and both `source.fetch`/`source.retry`) get all
four protections. The remaining five (`domain.retype`, `source.add`,
`source.remove`, `source.update`, `source.attach`, `extract.add`, `tag.apply`)
got the parse moved inside their `try` and a `.catch()` on the consumer, but
keep their own hand-written bodies and have no per-message deadline. That is
acceptable because the deadline in `getDb()` closes the observed hang for all of
them — every one begins with `await getDb()` — but they are not fully hardened.
