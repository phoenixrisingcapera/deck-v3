  risk
lede: '`person.apply` writes `linkedin_profile_url` as a scalar only, so accept discards

# Team-crawl accept: links dropped, row lingers

## The two symptoms (operator-confirmed, 2026-07-24 evening)

1. **Crawled links don't save.** The team crawl usually finds a LinkedIn
   URL (and often a bio page) per person. Accept runs `person.apply` +
   `person.affiliate` — and `person.apply`'s create branch writes
   `linkedin_profile_url` only as a scalar matching field
   (`person-resolver.ts` CREATE), never as a `personal_links[]` entry. The
   new person's card shows zero links; the crawl's best evidence is
   silently discarded.
2. **The accepted row stays staged.** After accept the row flips to
   "added ✓" but remains in the staged list. The person now exists in the
   People list AND in the staged results — redundant state that invites a
   second save (via re-accept paths or operator confusion). An accepted
   row should be CONSUMED: it leaves the staged list; the person appearing
   in the People list above is the confirmation.

## The fix (this doc precedes the implementation by minutes)

- On accept, after apply + affiliate: add the crawled `linkedin_url` and
  `bio_url` to the person via the existing `person.links.add` —
  **on created persons only** (matched persons may already carry them;
  additive-not-duplicative, per [[Additive enrichment never overrides
  accepted|additive discipline]]). Link failures degrade soft — the person
  + affiliation are the core writes.
- On success, remove the row from the staged list entirely (skip
  semantics). The "N staged" count and Done-clear affordance follow.
