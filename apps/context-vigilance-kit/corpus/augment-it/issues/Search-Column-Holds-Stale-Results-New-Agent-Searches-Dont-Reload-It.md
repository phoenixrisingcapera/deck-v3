title: The search column holds stale results — a new agent search doesn't reload it
lede: The team crawl bypasses the Search & Add envelope, so the column sits frozen
  on the last search's candidates, masquerading as current.

# The search column doesn't follow the latest search

## The symptom (operator-reported, 2026-07-24 evening)

1. 🤖 crawl on identity links → the Search & Add column opens with
   candidates. Good — that column is where results belong.
2. Fire the next agent search — the people/team crawl — and the column
   **keeps the old identity-links results**. Nothing tells the operator
   they're looking at a previous search; the new search's activity isn't
   reflected there at all.

## Why (two designs colliding)

- The links/streams crawls ride the Search & Add envelope
  (`augment-it:search-request`), so a NEW envelope does reload the column —
  but only those targets send one.
- The **team crawl deliberately bypasses the column**: its candidates stage
  on the workbench's People section (`StagedPeople`), per the accept-gate
  design. Nothing clears or re-labels the Search & Add pane, so it sits
  frozen on the last envelope — stale results masquerading as current.

The operator's mental model is simpler and better: **the third column is
THE results surface; whatever agent search ran last is what it shows.**

## Direction (jotted)

- Either route team-crawl results into the column too (person-shaped rows
  with the same accept gate the staged section has — the column becomes the
  one home for every crawl's candidates), or
- Keep the split but make the column state honest: a new agent action
  anywhere (team crawl included) clears or visibly supersedes the pane
  ("results from a previous search — re-crawl to refresh"), and the pane
  header always names the search that produced what's shown (target + org +
  when).
- Either way, results want a timestamp/provenance line — "identity links ·
  Quell Foundation · 5:35pm" — so stale can never impersonate fresh
  (the day's recurring stale-state theme;
  [[Crawl-Progress-Is-A-Black-Box-Needs-Traces-The-Operator-Can-Watch]] is
  the sibling on the same pane).

## Open questions

- [ ] Do person-shaped candidates belong in ResultRow (url-centric today) or
  does the column grow a second row type? (The component-library issue
  looms here.)
- [ ] Should the column auto-clear when its launching org card changes
  (roster click elsewhere), independent of new searches?
