# Initial User Experience

<!-- developing — stub captured 2026-06-01. The shape this should cover:
       - what loads at http://localhost:3100 (or the deployed equivalent)
         for a user with no session and no record sets;
       - the minimal onboarding (skippable, never blocking, never re-shown
         once skipped) that points at the Flow widget and the first step;
       - the seam where the dual identity surfaces (do we offer the
         "see the architecture" reveal up front, or only via the per-remote
         API-docs CTA from [[API-First-In-App-Documentation]]?);
       - the auth gate's first impression (informed by
         [[../blueprints/Auth-Patterns-following-Astro-Knots-Patterns]]).
     Body to develop with the user. -->

  the auth gate is part of the first 30 seconds; the patterns it follows
