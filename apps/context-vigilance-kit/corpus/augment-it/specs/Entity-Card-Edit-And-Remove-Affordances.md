title: Entity-Card Edit & Remove Affordances — every visible property gets a micro-button
  pair
lede: The org card views and edits in place, but only additively — a misclicked ➕
  today required a direct database write to undo. Every entry and identity property
  the card shows grows ✎ and × micro-buttons.

# Entity-Card Edit & Remove Affordances

## Why Care?

The operator ruling that shaped the org card — "no two loops, two apps;
one screen that views AND edits in place" — was only half-honored. The
card edits in one direction: additive. Today (2026-07-24) the operator
accidentally ➕'d `alpha.school` as Princeton University's identity URL,
and the only undo was an agent session doing a raw SurrealDB `UPDATE`.
The additive discipline that protects canonical data from agents also
locks the *human* out of corrections — exactly backwards for the
human-in-the-drivers-seat model: agents propose, the operator disposes,
and disposal includes *removing what's wrong*.

The rule this spec sets: **anything the card renders, the operator can
edit; anything the operator (or an accepted candidate) put on a list, the
operator can remove.** Micro-buttons, in place, no other surface.

## Scope

1. **List entries** — org card's three `AdditiveList`s (identity/social
   links, pulse streams, corpus items) and the person-card lists that
   reuse the component. Each row gets:
   - **✎ edit** — patch `kind` (all lists), `name` (streams — already
     shipped via `organization.streams.update`), and `url` itself.
   - **× remove** — delete the entry, inline confirm ("remove
     alpha.school from Identity & social links?"), no modal.
2. **Identity block** — the `<dl>` properties: complete/conventional
   name (rides the existing `resolver.update_org`, which the workbench
   never exposed), aliases (add ✕-chip removal), domains (same chip
   pattern).
3. **Affiliation edges** *(same-day extension — the Marla Blow case:
   accepted against the wrong org, no way to detach)* — the expanded
   person card shows its affiliation ("role at OrgName") with × (
   `person.unaffiliate`: edge delete + `affiliation_removed` observation;
   person, org, and history all stay) and a "+ other org" door that
   reuses the bio-promotion gate with no seeding entry.
4. **Out of scope** — affiliation *rating* flows, and merge/dedupe
   (gh #30, its own surface).

## Decisions

- **D1 — Removal is a first-class capability, not a UI trick.** New
  verbs, mirroring the add pair shapes, all match-by-URL (the de-facto
  entry key everywhere — dedupe, scan, streams.update precedent):
  `organization.links.update` / `organization.links.remove`,
  `organization.streams.remove`, `organization.corpus.update` /
  `organization.corpus.remove`, and the person twins
  (`person.links.remove`, `person.corpus.remove`). Served by
  record-surrealdb-resolver beside their add siblings; 30s Cloud
  round-trip budget.
- **D2 — Updates are flat-shaped, swap-in-place.** `*.update {org_slug,
  url, new_url?, kind?, client}` (streams keep `name?` too) — the same
  flat shape `organization.streams.update` established, which just gains
  `new_url`. The handler patches the entry in place so `added_at`
  provenance survives a typo fix; a corpus URL edit re-resolves the
  entry's `content_id` so the ledger bond stays true.
- **D3 — Corpus removes detach the entry, never delete content.**
  `organization.corpus.remove` pulls the entry off `org_corpus`; fetched
  markdown in the per-client corpus filesystem and `content_items` rows
  stay (other records/clients may reference them; storage is subscale —
  the redundancy ethos). A later sweep can garbage-collect orphans if it
  ever matters.
- **D4 — Removal leaves a trail.** Every remove writes one observation
  (`predicate: 'entry_removed'`, object = the URL, `client` tag, actor
  attribution) so canonical history keeps what-was-there-and-when without
  keeping the wrong data live. Accumulate observations, not overwrites.
- **D5 — Micro-buttons are hover-revealed, confirm inline.** Row rest
  state stays as today; hover (or row focus) reveals `✎ ×` at the row's
  right edge, sized to the existing `.ow-plus` class. × flips to an
  inline "remove? yes / keep" pair — the Search-Results-Queue dismiss
  confirm pattern, no dialogs. The streams ✎ generalizes to all lists.
- **D6 — Wire discipline unchanged.** Slugs/uuids only, `client` on
  every call, `augment-it:entity-updated` broadcast after every mutation
  so the card, roster counts, and any open search-rail cards refetch.

## Implementation sketch

1. **Capabilities** — handlers in record-surrealdb-resolver (links.ts /
   streams / corpus modules beside the adds), capability map + timeout
   entries in `services/workspace/src/capabilities.ts`.
2. **AdditiveList** — `onedit` generalizes from streams-only to all
   lists (kind editing everywhere, name where `nameable`); new
   `onremove` prop with the inline confirm; hover-reveal CSS.
3. **OrgCard / PersonCard** — wire the new verbs; identity block gains
   name-edit (via `resolver.update_org`) and alias/domain chip removal.
4. **Proof** — extend `prove-augment-from-db-capabilities.mjs` with the
   remove/update round-trips against the Aspen safe target; browser
   drive: add a wrong link, edit its kind, remove it, watch the card and
   roster counts refetch.

## Resolved questions

- [x] **× on a stream that fed corpus items warns.** Operator confirmed
  2026-07-24 ("Yah warn if it fed a corpus"). Implemented as a
  domain-match approximation — corpus entries don't record their source
  stream, so the confirm notes "this stream's domain fed N corpus items
  — they stay". Exact stream→item lineage is a later refinement if scan
  provenance ever lands on corpus entries.
- [x] **Alias/domain removal rides `resolver.update_org`** — it already
  owns the identity block; `aliases`/`domains` travel as full-array
  replacements the chip editors compute client-side.
