# Kopia — Profile

A profile of Kopia as it lives in this study (`studies/sync-and-content-version-control/kopia`, pinned at `4ebb2be6`, nearest tag `v0.23.1`, 2026-08-21). Apache-2.0, Go, one binary that is also a server.

Read this immediately after [[Profile__Restic]]. They make the same bet — content-addressed snapshots natively into a bucket — and the differences are exactly where the Lossless ask lives.

## TL;DR

Kopia is restic's design with two additions that turn out to matter here more than any performance difference:

1. **`snapshot.Manifest` carries `Description string`** (`snapshot/manifest.go:22`) — the human-written reason restic has no field for.
2. **Policies attach to a directory path and inherit down the tree** (`snapshot/policy/policy_tree.go`, `policy_merge.go`) — retention, compression, file selection, and hooks, configured *per directory*, which is the literal shape of "per-dir sync with version control."

Architecturally it is cleanly layered, and the layers are worth naming because they are the vocabulary any home-grown design ends up reinventing:

| Layer | Package | Job |
|---|---|---|
| **blob** | `repo/blob` | *"simple storage of immutable, unstructured binary large objects"* (`repo/blob/doc.go:1`) — the provider seam |
| **content** | `repo/content` | Encryption, dedup, packing of blobs into content-addressed units |
| **object** | `repo/object` | Splitting large streams into contents; reassembly |
| **manifest** | `repo/manifest` | *"managing JSON-based manifests in repository"* (`repo/manifest/manifest_manager.go:1`) |
| **snapshot** | `snapshot/` | Directory trees, policies, retention, restore |

**One sentence:** *Kopia is restic plus a description field, plus a per-directory inheriting policy tree, plus a server and web UI — which makes it the closest thing in this study to the syncbox as described, still missing only the sync.*

## The two features that matter for this study

### `Description`, `Tags`, and `Pins` on the manifest

`snapshot/manifest.go:18-40`:

```go
type Manifest struct {
	ID     manifest.ID `json:"id"`
	Source SourceInfo  `json:"source"`

	Description string          `json:"description"`
	StartTime   fs.UTCTimestamp `json:"startTime"`
	EndTime     fs.UTCTimestamp `json:"endTime"`

	Stats            Stats  `json:"stats"`
	IncompleteReason string `json:"incomplete,omitempty"`
	RootEntry        *DirEntry `json:"rootEntry"`
	RetentionReasons []string  `json:"-"`
	Tags             map[string]string `json:"tags,omitempty"`
	Pins             []string          `json:"pins,omitempty"`
}
```

Four fields here that restic's `Snapshot` does not have, and each answers something the ask needs:

- **`Description`** — the free-text reason. *"Revised the funder-fit section after Tuesday's call."* This is the field the make-progress-visible goal has been missing in every other entry except Seafile's `Commit.Desc`, and unlike Seafile's it sits in a store that talks to R2 natively.
- **`Tags map[string]string`** — key-value, not restic's flat `[]string`. `client=reach-edu`, `kind=checkpoint` vs `kind=autosave` is expressible without string conventions.
- **`Pins []string`** — named manual holds that keep a snapshot out of expiry. `UpdatePins` (`:43`) adds and removes them. "The client asked us to keep this one" is a pin, not a policy exception.
- **`RetentionReasons []string`** — computed, not persisted (`json:"-"`), explaining *why* a given snapshot survived the last expiry pass. A retention system that can explain itself.

`IncompleteReason` deserves a note too: a snapshot can be recorded as partial with a stated cause, rather than either succeeding or vanishing. Useful for anything running unattended.

### The per-directory policy tree

`snapshot/policy/` is the largest idea in the entry. Policies are objects attached to a `SourceInfo` (host + user + path) and merged down the directory tree (`policy_tree.go`, `policy_merge.go`, `policy_manager.go:42-52`). The policy kinds are separate files and each is genuinely per-directory:

`retention_policy.go` · `compression_policy.go` · `files_policy.go` · `scheduling_policy.go` · `splitter_policy.go` · `upload_policy.go` · `error_handling_policy.go` · `logging_policy.go` · `actions_policy.go`

`RetentionPolicy` (`retention_policy.go:23-31`) is the restic grammar plus one good idea:

```go
KeepLatest, KeepHourly, KeepDaily, KeepWeekly, KeepMonthly, KeepAnnual *OptionalInt
IgnoreIdenticalSnapshots *OptionalBool
```

`IgnoreIdenticalSnapshots` is the fix for the failure mode an autosave loop guarantees: a hundred snapshots a day of an unchanged corpus, each cheap in bytes and each costing a manifest and a listing row.

The genuinely unusual move is the parallel `*PolicyDefinition` structs (`retention_policy.go:34-37`, `actions_policy.go:17-20`). For every field in the effective policy, Kopia records **which policy level supplied that value** as a `SourceInfo`. Effective configuration with provenance, per field. Anyone who has debugged inherited config knows what that is worth.

**`ActionsPolicy`** (`actions_policy.go:6-14`) is a hook seam: `BeforeFolder` / `AfterFolder` (explicitly *not* inherited) and `BeforeSnapshotRoot` / `AfterSnapshotRoot` (inherited). That is where "run the quality scan before checkpointing" or "re-ingest to Chroma after" would attach without writing an orchestrator.

## Storage — providers plus a wrapper stack

`repo/blob/`: `s3`, `azure`, `b2`, `gcs`, `gdrive`, `filesystem`, `sftp`, `webdav`, `rclone`. Same story as restic — **S3-compatible is a first-class target and no object versioning is required**, so R2 is fine, and `rclone` composes with a transport decision the tree already made.

The decorators around them are the more interesting half: `readonly`, `retrying`, `throttling`, `logging`, `storagemetrics`, `sharded`, `beforeop`. Two are worth calling out:

- **`readonly`** (`repo/blob/readonly/readonly_storage.go`) — a wrapper that refuses every mutation and reports `IsReadOnly() true`. Structural asymmetry **at the storage layer**, one level below where [[Profile__Syncthing]] puts it (folder type) and [[Profile__Seafile]] puts it (server permission). Combined with a read-scoped R2 token, a client-facing replica becomes read-only in two independent ways.
- **`sharded`** — the directory-fan-out strategy (`data/<ab>/…`) as a configurable concern rather than a hardcoded scheme.

`repo/ecc/` adds optional Reed-Solomon error correction over blobs, which no other entry in this study offers.

## Splitters — pluggable, unlike everyone else

`repo/splitter/`: `splitter_fixed.go`, `splitter_buzhash32.go`, `splitter_rabinkarp64.go`, plus a pool. Default is **`DYNAMIC-4M-BUZHASH`** (`repo/splitter/splitter.go:88-89`) — a 4 MiB average, notably larger than restic's 1 MiB and Seafile's 1 MiB.

And because there is a `splitter_policy.go`, **the chunking algorithm is a per-directory setting**. Prose directories get fixed or large-average splitting; a PDF directory gets buzhash. No other entry exposes this at all, and for a corpus that mixes 4 KB markdown with 40 MB reports it is the right knob to have.

Compression is likewise per-policy (`compression_policy.go`) across `zstd`, `lz4`, `s2`, `gzip`, `pgzip`, `deflate` (`repo/compression/`). restic added zstd repository-wide; Kopia makes it a per-directory choice.

## Where it still does not reach

**1. It does not sync.** Same as restic: a snapshot is a one-way capture. There is no bidirectional reconciliation, no conflict model, no "the client edited it too." `kopia server` and its web UI serve *browsing and triggering snapshots*, not a shared editing surface.

**2. There is still no `live/` tree.** The repository is packed, encrypted contents. `kopia mount` (`cli/command_mount.go`, `internal/server/api_mount.go`) gives a FUSE view and the server offers object download, but the bucket does not hold a plain markdown tree anyone could `rclone sync` and open in Obsidian. Constraint 1 — *files-as-truth, hand-recoverable* — does not survive here either.

**3. More machinery than restic.** Five layers, a policy engine, a server, a web UI, ECC, six compressors. All well-factored, and all surface area. restic's *"one binary, one repository, six commands"* is a real advantage if the only requirement is snapshots.

## How it scores against the study checklist

| Checklist item | Kopia |
|---|---|
| **Unit of sync** | Not a sync tool. Unit of *policy and history* is the **directory**, which is the ask's own unit |
| **Where history lives** | The store — content-addressed, packed, encrypted, in a bucket |
| **Content addressing** | Yes, and the splitter is pluggable and per-directory (default `DYNAMIC-4M-BUZHASH`) |
| **Blob-storage story** | **Native.** Nine providers incl. `s3` and `rclone`; no object versioning needed |
| **Conflict semantics** | None. Not a concurrent-edit system |
| **Asymmetry** | **`readonly` storage wrapper** — structural, at the lowest layer |
| **Hand-recoverability** | Poor. Packed + encrypted; `mount` and the server soften it |
| **Labels / legibility** | **Best in the study.** `Description` + key-value `Tags` + `Pins` + `RetentionReasons` + `Stats` |
| **Operational cost** | One binary, optionally a server. Higher conceptual surface than restic |

## What this changes about the Lossless decision

restic proved the HISTORY design was already built. **Kopia proves the two things restic couldn't do are also already built** — everything except the browsable `live/` tree:

- The free-text reason on a version → `Description`
- Per-directory retention and behaviour → the policy tree
- Structural read-only for a client replica → `readonly` + a read-scoped token
- Pin the checkpoints that matter, thin the rest → `Pins` + `IgnoreIdenticalSnapshots`
- Run the quality scan around a checkpoint → `ActionsPolicy`

Which sharpens the split proposed in [[Profile__Restic]] into something more specific and cheaper:

> `live/` stays exactly as designed — plain markdown in the bucket via rclone, hand-recoverable. History becomes a **Kopia** repository beside it, one per client, with the client's sentence as `--description` and `client=<slug>` in `Tags`. What corpora-builder writes is only the gesture, the sentence, and the feed that renders `Description` + `Stats` for someone who will not read a diff.

**The honest counterweight:** this trades ~250 lines of Python for a Go binary in the deployment, a repository format we do not control, and a `restore` step between the bucket and a human. Whether that trade is good depends entirely on whether the `live/` tree stays canonical. **If `live/` is the truth and history is a safety net, adopt. If history is the truth, write it.** The plan should say which.

## Read next

- `snapshot/manifest.go:18-40` — read it directly against restic's `internal/data/snapshot.go:17-34`; the diff is the study's answer on legibility
- `snapshot/policy/retention_policy.go:23-37` — the retention grammar and, below it, the per-field provenance struct
- `snapshot/policy/actions_policy.go:6-14` — the hook seam
- `repo/blob/readonly/readonly_storage.go` — structural read-only in 60 lines
- `repo/splitter/splitter.go:88-89` — the default, then `snapshot/policy/splitter_policy.go` for why it is per-directory
