# Jujutsu (`jj`) — Profile

A profile of Jujutsu as it lives in this study (`studies/sync-and-content-version-control/jj`, pinned at `9d905d5` / v0.44.0 / 2026-08-21). Every claim cites a pinned path so you can read the source rather than trust the paraphrase.

This is the study's **history-lives-in-the-VCS** entry, and it is here for one specific reason: `flave-ai/context-v/specs/Master-Flave-An-Agent-Native-Document-Format-and-Publisher.md` §8.2 resolved on 2026-08-14 that **every `.flave` bundle is a `jj` repo**, driven by an agent under the hood. That decision rests on two load-bearing claims — *"git compatibility is retained, not sacrificed"* and *"the operation log with `jj undo` … is the single strongest argument for `jj` here."* This profile tests both against source.

## TL;DR

`jj` is a Git-compatible VCS whose distinguishing move is that **the working copy *is* a commit**, auto-snapshotted on every command — there is no staging area and no "did I forget to commit." On top of that sits an **operation log**: a second, higher-level history of *repository operations*, which is what makes `jj undo` able to reverse "the agent restructured six blocks and moved a chart" as one gesture.

Storage is deliberately abstracted. The architecture doc states the design principle outright (`docs/technical/architecture.md:29-38`):

> One overarching principle in the design is that it should be easy to change where data is stored. The goal was to be able to put storage on local-disk by default **but also be able to move storage to the cloud** at Google (and for anyone).

That principle is real in the trait design and **unimplemented in the shipped code**. Two things follow, and they pull in opposite directions for anyone hoping to marry `jj` to blob storage.

**One sentence:** *Jujutsu is a Git-compatible VCS with an operation-log undo model and a genuinely storage-agnostic five-backend architecture, of which exactly one backend (Git) is production-grade and none targets object storage.*

## Where history lives — and it is five places, not one

The single most useful correction this profile makes to the casual reading: **`jj` does not have "a backend."** `StoreFactories` (`lib/src/repo.rs:434-440`) registers **five independent factory kinds**:

```rust
pub struct StoreFactories {
    backend_factories: HashMap<String, BackendFactory>,              // commits, trees, files
    op_store_factories: HashMap<String, OpStoreFactory>,             // the operation log
    op_heads_store_factories: HashMap<String, OpHeadsStoreFactory>,  // heads of that log
    index_store_factories: HashMap<String, IndexStoreFactory>,       // the commit index
    submodule_store_factories: HashMap<String, SubmoduleStoreFactory>,
}
```

Each is selected by a type file on disk — `.jj/repo/store/type`, `.jj/repo/index/type`, `.jj/repo/op_store/type`, `.jj/repo/op_heads/type` (`docs/technical/architecture.md:41-44`) — and each resolves to a directory under `.jj/repo/` (`lib/src/repo.rs:221-255`). The working copy is a sixth store, at `.jj/working_copy/` (`lib/src/workspace.rs:139`), holding `tree_state` and `checkout` (`lib/src/local_working_copy.rs:1110`, `:2574`).

**Consequence for "put `jj` on R2":** implementing `Backend` gets you commits, trees, and file blobs in the bucket. The operation log — the feature §8.2 calls the strongest argument for `jj` — is `OpStore`, a *different* trait, and would need its own implementation, as would `OpHeadsStore` and `IndexStore`. "Write a jj backend" is four backends.

### The `Backend` trait is explicitly cloud-shaped

Credit where due: this is not a local-only interface retrofitted with async. `pub trait Backend` (`lib/src/backend.rs:728`) is `#[async_trait]` throughout, `read_file` returns a streaming `Pin<Box<dyn AsyncRead + Send>>` rather than a `Vec<u8>` (`lib/src/backend.rs:764-769`), and `concurrency()` documents the remote case in as many words (`lib/src/backend.rs:751-761`):

> An estimate of how many concurrent requests this backend handles well. A local backend like the Git backend … may want to set this to 1. **A cloud-backed backend may want to set it to 100 or so.**

`get_copy_records` returns a `BoxStream` and the doc says why: *"Streaming by design to better support large backends which may have very large single-file histories"* (`lib/src/backend.rs:847-853`). The door is deliberately open. Nobody has walked through it in-tree.

### What actually ships

`default_backend_factories()` (`lib/src/default_backend_factories.rs:31-56`) registers exactly three, one of which is test-only:

| Backend | Status | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| `GitBackend` | Production, feature-gated on `git` | A real Git object database, via [gitoxide](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide) |
| `SimpleBackend` | **"just a proof of concept"** (`docs/technical/architecture.md:92-95`) | One file per object, Blake2b-512 hashes |
| `SecretBackend` | `#[cfg(feature = "testing")]` | Test fixture |

`SimpleBackend` is the closest thing to a content-addressed store you could naively map onto a bucket — `init` creates five flat directories, `commits/`, `trees/`, `files/`, `symlinks/`, `conflicts/`, and writes one file per hash (`lib/src/simple_backend.rs:107-112`, `:137-149`), with 64-byte commit IDs (`:71`). That shape is a near-exact match for `objects/<ab>/<sha256>` in corpora-builder's HISTORY layout. But it is a proof of concept by the maintainers' own label, and it is **not** what a colocated repo uses.

**There is no S3/R2 backend in the open-source tree.** Google's cloud-backed deployment (Piper/CitC-shaped) is the motivating use case named in the architecture doc; it is not code you can read here.

## The finding that matters most for `.flave`

§8.2's compatibility claim is:

> `jj` uses a git-compatible backend and colocates (`jj git init --colocate`), so … any user or CI system that only speaks git sees a normal git repo. **`jj` is our interface to history; git remains the interchange format.**

That is true, and **it is only half the repository.** The `GitBackend` cannot store everything `jj`'s model carries, so it keeps the remainder outside git (`docs/technical/architecture.md:76-86`):

> Commit data that is available in Jujutsu's model but not in Git's model is stored in a `StackedTable` in **`.jj/repo/store/extra/`**. That is currently the **change ID** and the **list of predecessors**. For commits that don't have any data in that table, which is any commit created by `git`, we use an empty list as predecessors, and **the bit-reversed commit ID as change ID**.

Confirmed in code: `store_path.join("extra")` and the `extra_metadata_store: TableStore` field (`lib/src/git_backend.rs:293`, `:179`). Separately, `jj` writes `refs/jj/keep/` refs so Git GC does not collect commits still reachable from the operation log (`lib/src/git_backend.rs:99`).

So a colocated `.flave` bundle has two halves with different portability:

| Half | Lives in | Survives a git-only round-trip? |
|---|---|---|
| Commits, trees, file blobs | `.git/` | **Yes.** This is the real interchange win. |
| Change IDs, predecessors | `.jj/repo/store/extra/` | **No** — regenerated as bit-reversed commit IDs |
| Operation log + heads | `.jj/repo/op_store/`, `op_heads/` | **No** |
| Working-copy state | `.jj/working_copy/tree_state`, `checkout` | **No** |

**Send someone a `.flave` bundle as git, and they receive the content and lose the undo.** §8.2 names *stable change IDs across rewrites* as the thing that lets an agent durably reference *"the change where I restructured the metrics section"* — that ID is in `extra/`, not in git, and a git-only recipient gets a bit-reversed commit hash instead, which is exactly the churn §8.2 says git commit hashes suffer from.

This does not invalidate the decision. It sharpens it: **`jj` is excellent as a local history engine for a single author, and its interchange story is git's, not its own.** Any sync design must carry `.jj/` deliberately or accept that history is local-only.

### Git LFS: no — and the failure is silent

`docs/git-compatibility.md:72` states it in three words:

> **Git LFS: No.** ([#80](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/80))

A grep for `lfs` or `smudge` across the whole source returns nothing: **jj does
not run git's clean/smudge filters at all.** In an LFS repo, jj's working-copy
snapshot therefore sees what LFS smudged onto disk — the real file — and stores
*that*, overwriting the pointer.

**Confirmed the expensive way, 2026-08-22.** `jj git init --colocate` in a client
corpus repo whose `.gitattributes` carried `*.pdf filter=lfs`. A single `jj
describe` + `jj new`, touching no files, produced a commit reading `78 updated ·
282.5 MB` with diffstat lines like `Bin 131 -> 729490 bytes`. That signature — a
~130-byte binary becoming megabytes — is an LFS pointer being replaced by its own
content. Reverted; nothing pushed.

Nothing warns you. jj prints "Initialized repo", the commit looks ordinary, and
`git status` is clean before and after because LFS keeps real bytes on disk by
design. Only the diffstat gives it away.

This matters for the study's central question in a specific way: **a corpus is
markdown plus large binaries**, which is precisely why these repos use LFS, and
precisely the shape jj handles worst. jj's own roadmap has "Better support for
large files" as future work (`docs/roadmap.md:78`).

Guardrail: `ai-labs/context-v/reminders/Never-Run-JJ-In-A-Git-LFS-Repo.md`.

### And `.jj/` is the thing you must not blind-sync

The working copy takes a real file lock — `working_copy.lock` via `FileLock::lock` (`lib/src/local_working_copy.rs:2645`, `lib/src/lock/unix.rs:32`) — and `workspace_store` locks with a sibling `.lock` file (`lib/src/workspace_store.rs:112`). The operation log is an append-only DAG whose heads are separate mutable state (`lib/src/op_store.rs:359`, `Operation { view_id, parents, metadata, … }`).

That is a live database with lock files, which is precisely the shape the 2026-07-08 exploration warned about:

> Continuously syncing a live `.git` working tree with any file-sync tool (Dropbox, Nextcloud, Syncthing, Seafile alike) is a well-known way to corrupt a git repository.

`.jj/` is strictly worse than `.git/` for this, because it holds *more* mutable state and because a corrupted op log destroys the undo history rather than just the content (which git still has). **Blind file-sync of a `jj` repo is not a viable transport.** The viable shapes are: push/pull to a git remote (transport is git, not the filesystem), or an app-mediated exchange of bundles.

## Conflict semantics — the genuinely differentiated part

`jj` records conflicts as **first-class values in the tree** rather than as a blocked operation. A merge never hard-fails; the resulting commit *contains* conflicts, which are represented (`lib/src/conflicts.rs`, `lib/src/merge.rs`, `lib/src/conflict_labels.rs`) and resolvable later. §8.4 leans on this correctly — *"the only tolerable behavior for a non-developer receiving a colleague's edits."*

Measured against this study's checklist, that is a real advantage over every file-sync entry, all of which resolve conflicts by **renaming and keeping both** and thereby handing a non-technical person two files and no guidance. It is worth being precise about what it buys, though: `jj` makes the conflict *representable and non-blocking*. It does not make it *understood*. Someone still has to resolve it, and for prose the resolution UI is entirely on the application.

## Operational story

Single static binary, no daemon, no server. Optional Watchman integration for large working copies — and note that Watchman is the **only** non-test fsmonitor (`lib/src/fsmonitor.rs:39-49`), so "watch the filesystem" means "install Watchman," not "we ship a watcher." For a `.flave` bundle (small, single-author) this is irrelevant; for a 517-file / 156MB client corpus it is a real dependency question.

## How it scores against the study checklist

| Checklist item | jj |
|---|---|
| **Unit of sync** | The repository. Nesting is submodules — a `SubmoduleStore` factory exists but `DefaultSubmoduleStore` is minimal |
| **Where history lives** | In the VCS, split across five stores |
| **Content addressing** | Yes, whole-object. Git backend: SHA-1/SHA-256 per git. SimpleBackend: Blake2b-512 |
| **Blob-storage story** | **Trait-ready, implementation-absent.** Four traits to write, in Rust, against a fast-moving upstream |
| **Large binaries** | **Git LFS unsupported.** In an LFS repo jj commits the real bytes over the pointers, silently |
| **Conflict semantics** | Best in the study — recorded, not blocking. Resolution UI is still yours to build |
| **Asymmetry** | None structural. Read-only is a remote-permissions matter, not a repo property |
| **Hand-recoverability** | The working copy is plain files. History needs `jj` (or git, minus change IDs and the op log) |
| **Labels / legibility** | Commit descriptions + `jj op log` with human-readable operation descriptions. Raw material for a progress feed, not a feed |
| **Operational cost** | One binary. Watchman optional. No server |
