# Grill Me — A Per-Section User-Input Moment in MemoPop Runs

## The problem

For some memo sections, the gap between the **exhaustive research artifact** and the **synthesized section that ships in the memo** is too large for the model to bridge on its own without making a frame choice that should belong to the user.

The clearest case is competitive analysis (see [[competitive-analysis]] in `context-v/agent-skills/`):

- The research file should be **exhaustive**: every competitor classified on two axes (stage ring × competitor type), with notes, sources, and reasoning for every noisewashing-vs-genuine-threat reclassification.
- The memo section must be **synthesized**: a table, a list grouped by ring or type, a concentric-ring diagram, or a 2×2 — collapsed to something a partner can scan in under a minute.

A model picking the synthesis frame unaided will default to whatever pattern its training distribution suggests, which is often not what the *firm* wants, not what the *deal* needs, and not what the *partner reading the memo* will respond to. The same competitive corpus could land as:

- A 4-quadrant matrix (price × segment, or moat × growth)
- A concentric-ring landscape diagram
- A grouped list by ring (early stage / scaleup / incumbent) with noisewashing called out
- A short "the 3 competitors who matter" prose paragraph and a footnoted long list
- A heads-up table of direct competitors only, with the rest deferred to the research file

All five are defensible. None is universally right. The right frame depends on a judgment the user holds and the model doesn't.

## The proposal

Introduce an optional **grill-me moment** in the orchestrator run: a checkpoint where, for any section configured to use it, the pipeline pauses *after* research/classification is complete and *before* the section is synthesized into final-memo form. At that checkpoint, MemoPop turns the question around — instead of asking the user to fill in a blank, it presents what it found and asks the user to make a short list of choices that determine the synthesis frame.

The name "grill me" captures the inversion: usually the user briefs the system; here the system briefs the user and asks them to pick.

### Why "generic from day one"

The user's call. Competitive is the first adopter — but `team`, `market`, `risks`, and `recommendation` all have the same shape: exhaustive research, multiple defensible synthesis frames, a firm/partner preference that the model can't infer. Building this as a per-section mechanism (rather than a competitive-section feature) means later adopters wire in by adding a `grill_me:` block to their outline section, not by adding a second code path.

## Where it fits in the orchestrator run

Today's pipeline (per `apps/memopop-orchestrator/CLAUDE.md`):

```
deck_analyst → research → writer (section-by-section)
  → trademark/socials/link/citation enrichment
  → toc → citation_validator → fact_checker → validator → supervisor
```

The grill-me checkpoint sits **between the section's research/classification step and the writer's synthesis of that section**:

```
[section research, exhaustive]
    ↓
[classification / structuring within the research file]
    ↓
GRILL-ME CHECKPOINT  ← pause, present, ask user to pick synthesis frame
    ↓
[writer synthesizes the section using the user's frame choice]
    ↓
[downstream enrichment unchanged]
```

For sections without a configured grill-me block, the pipeline proceeds as today. For sections with one, the pipeline halts on the checkpoint until the UI returns a user decision, then resumes with that decision injected into the writer's context.

This means grill-me is **opt-in per section, per outline** — not a global mode change.

## What the user sees at the moment

For the competitive section, the UI presents:

1. **What we found.** A compact summary of the research corpus: count of competitors by ring × type, the few flagged for noisewashing-vs-genuine-threat reclassification, sources used.
2. **What's ambiguous.** Explicit calls-out: e.g., "we classified Microsoft Azure as `genuine threat` rather than `noisewashing` — confirm/flip?" or "we found 11 candidates for `direct`; the taxonomy says this is too many — which 3 should be the front-page direct competitors?"
3. **Synthesis frame options.** A short menu of frames the writer could use, each with a one-line preview (table / ring diagram / grouped list / front-page short list + long footnote / matrix on which two axes). Recommended frame at the top, with the reasoning.
4. **Free-text override.** "Tell us what you actually want."

The user's response — frame choice, reclassifications, free-text — becomes structured input that the writer agent reads alongside the research file.

## Schema sketch

A `grill_me` block on an outline section (`templates/outlines/`) would look roughly like:

```yaml
sections:
  - number: 6
    name: "Competitive Landscape"
    filename: "06-competitive-landscape.md"
    grill_me:
      enabled: true
      summarize:
        - "count_by_ring_and_type"
        - "noisewashing_reclassifications"
        - "sources_used"
      ambiguities:
        - rule: "direct_count > 3"
          prompt: "We found {n} direct competitors; the taxonomy says this is too many. Pick the front-page set."
        - rule: "any noisewashing_to_genuine_threat reclassifications"
          prompt: "Confirm or flip each reclassification."
      frame_options:
        - id: "ring_diagram"
          label: "Concentric-ring landscape diagram"
          recommend_when: "competitors span 3+ rings"
        - id: "grouped_list"
          label: "List grouped by ring, noisewashing called out"
          recommend_when: "competitors cluster in 1-2 rings"
        - id: "front_page_short_list"
          label: "3 competitors that matter, long list footnoted"
          recommend_when: "direct_count <= 3 and adjacent_count <= 5"
        - id: "matrix_2x2"
          label: "2×2 matrix on user-chosen axes"
      free_text: true
```

The orchestrator side reads this block, runs the summary/ambiguity computations against the research artifact, and emits a checkpoint event for the UI.

## Open design questions

1. **Sync or async pause?** Does the orchestrator halt the whole run until the user answers (simple, but blocks other sections), or does it proceed with sections that don't need grill-me and circle back? Async is better for long memo generation; sync is simpler to build.
2. **Headless / batch mode behavior.** If the run is unattended (CLI batch, scheduled job), grill-me should fall through to the `recommend_when` default rather than block forever. This needs to be a documented fallback, not an emergent behavior.
3. **State persistence.** The user's grill-me answers should land in `state.json` so a re-run can replay them by default and only re-prompt if the underlying research changed materially.
4. **Where the UI hook lives.** MemoPop native app already has the "✨ Curate Best Sources" pattern (per the orchestrator's CLAUDE.md §architectural direction). Grill-me checkpoints can probably reuse the same UI checkpoint mechanism — worth confirming before designing a parallel one.
5. **Does grill-me replace, or supplement, the existing evaluator agents?** For competitive specifically, `competitive_landscape_evaluator.py` already does some judgment work. Grill-me probably *moves* the framing judgment from evaluator-to-user rather than adding a second pass; the evaluator becomes a pre-grill prep step.
6. **How exhaustive should the "ambiguities" detection be?** Hand-authored rules per section vs. a model-generated "things I'd grill the user about" list. Probably both — rules for the deterministic stuff, model-generated for the judgment-call stuff.

## Why this isn't just "ask the model harder"

The model can produce any of the five competitive synthesis frames competently. What it cannot do is know which one *this firm, this partner, this deal* wants. That information lives outside the corpus. Asking the model to guess wastes a real opportunity to capture a 30-second user decision that materially improves the section. Grill-me is the mechanism for capturing that decision at the moment it would otherwise be guessed.

## Adoption sequence

1. Land the [[competitive-analysis]] taxonomy skill (done, this run).
2. Spec the orchestrator checkpoint protocol — what event the pipeline emits, what payload the UI expects, what payload the UI returns.
3. Add the `grill_me:` block to the competitive section of one outline and wire the orchestrator to honor it.
4. Build the UI checkpoint moment in MemoPop, starting with the competitive section's grill-me payload as the first concrete case.
5. Generalize: once the competitive moment works, document the schema and invite other sections (`team`, `risks`, `recommendation`) to add their own `grill_me:` blocks.
