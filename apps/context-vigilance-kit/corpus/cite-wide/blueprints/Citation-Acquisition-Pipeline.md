## Why This Is a Separate Concern

The Standards doc says **what** a canonical citation looks like. This doc says **how** one gets there. They're separated because the schema is rendering-target-neutral and survives across years; the acquisition mechanism is a moving target — APIs change, LLMs improve, archival strategies evolve.

The pipeline also exists because canonicalization is **not free**. Filling the rich schema requires HTTP fetches, HTML parsing, AI calls (each ~5-30s, ~$0.01-0.10 per source), and filesystem operations. These costs are acceptable for sources we consciously promote into the canonical knowledge base; they're absurd to pay for every random URL pasted into a doc.

**Decoupling capture from canonicalization is the key design move.** Capture is cheap — it happens automatically when a URL is dropped into a markdown file (today's `extractAndInsertCitation` flow). Canonicalization is expensive — it happens explicitly, on demand, when a contributor decides "this source is worth the full treatment."

**Why MCP server, not in-plugin code?**

- **Reuse across clients.** The same agent serves the Obsidian plugin, a CLI, and the Investment Memo Orchestrator. Putting the logic in the plugin would couple it to Obsidian's lifecycle.
- **Heavy lift outside Obsidian.** HTTP fetches with retry, content downloads, AI calls — these don't belong in Obsidian's renderer process. MCP runs as a separate Node/Python process.
- **Future-proofing for shared knowledge base.** When the personal KB → org KB transition happens, the MCP server becomes the org-shared agent (running on a server, accessed by all contributors). The plugin's role shrinks to "client of the canonical service."
- **Tool-use ergonomics.** Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-aware clients can talk to the same server directly — letting *us* canonicalize sources mid-conversation when working with an agent.

> **TODO (human):** Confirm MCP-server-first architecture vs in-plugin-first. The latter is faster to ship but harder to reuse. Recommend MCP-server.

## Tool Envelope

The agent needs these capabilities. For each, I've noted which existing tool fills the role and which gaps need new code.

| Capability | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP fetch with redirect chain capture | Standard `fetch` + redirect tracking | Build |
| HTML meta-tag parser (OG, Twitter, standard) | `cheerio` or `linkedom` | Build (~50 lines) |
| Favicon URL resolution | Convention-based: `<link rel="icon">` then `/favicon.ico` fallback | Build (~20 lines) |
| Jina.ai Reader (clean content extraction) | Already integrated in plugin via `urlCitationService` | Reuse |
| Claude API structured output (tool use) | Anthropic SDK `tools` param | Build (~100 lines wrapper) |
| UUID v4 generator | Standard library | Trivial |
| Hex code generator (collision-checked) | Existing `citationService.generateHexId` | Reuse (move to MCP) |
| Slug normalizer | Build deterministic helper: lowercase, strip non-alnum, collapse dashes | Build (~30 lines) |
| Filesystem read/write | Standard library | Trivial |
| Citation YAML serializer/parser | Existing `citationFileService` patterns + `js-yaml` | Reuse |

**Claude API specifics:**

- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 for classification and normalization tasks (cheaper, fast). Reserve Opus 4.7 for the ambiguous edge cases (lede-vs-subtitle when both seem plausible, publisher classification when type is unclear).
- **Tool use schema** for `publisher_type` classification:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "classify_publisher",
    "input_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "publisher_type": { "enum": [/* Train-Case taxonomy from Standards doc */] },
        "confidence": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1 },
        "reasoning": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["publisher_type", "confidence", "reasoning"]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Confidence threshold:** Below 0.7, fall back to `Other` and surface to human reviewer.
- **Prompt caching:** Cache the Standards doc + Field Guide as the system prompt. Per-source dynamic content (HTML excerpt, meta tags) goes in the user message. Material cost reduction across a sweep.

> **TODO (human):** Confirm model selection (Sonnet 4.6 default + Opus 4.7 for ambiguous). Could be flipped if Opus is dramatically better at one-shot classification.

## Phases

The agent runs phases in order. Each phase is **independently retryable** — if phase 4 fails, phases 1-3 stay valid. Output state is persisted between phases to support resume-from-failure.

### Phase 1 — Deterministic (no network, no AI)

- `internal_uuid` ← `generate_uuid_v4()`
- `reference_hexcode` ← provided by caller, OR `generate_hex_code(existing_codes)` if missing
- `default_slug` ← `normalize_slug(provided_title or hexcode-as-fallback)` — refined later
- `date_added` ← today (ISO 8601)
- `first_accessed_at_url` ← provided source URL
- `recently_accessed_at_url` ← `first_accessed_at_url` (mirrored on first capture)
- `date_recently_accessed` ← today (will update on re-fetches)

**Failure mode:** Phase 1 cannot fail. If it does, the agent has a bug — exit non-zero and surface.

### Phase 2 — Fetch + meta extraction (network, no AI)

- `http_fetch(first_accessed_at_url)` → if final URL differs from input, update `recently_accessed_at_url` to the final URL.
- Parse HTML for:
  - `<title>` and OG `og:title` → candidate `title`
  - `<meta name="description">`, `og:description`, `twitter:description` → candidate `lede` (first paragraph fallback for blog/magazine sources)
  - `<meta name="author">`, `<meta property="article:author">`, byline regexes → candidate `authors`
  - `<meta name="article:published_time">`, `og:article:published_time` → `date_published`
  - `<link rel="icon">` or `/favicon.ico` → `publisher_favicon_url`
  - `og:image`, `twitter:image` → `piece_og_image` and `piece_thumbnail_url`
  - URL hostname → candidate `publisher_url`

**Failure modes:**
- 404 / 410: skip phase, mark URL as dead in a side-channel log; continue with what we have.
- Timeout: retry once with longer timeout; then skip.
- Paywalled / requires auth: capture what we can; mark `lede` empty so AI doesn't try to invent one.

### Phase 3 — AI normalization (AI calls, no network beyond Claude)

For each candidate field from Phase 2, ask Claude to:

- **Pick `subtitle` vs `lede`** — based on the `publisher_type` (after Phase 4 classifies it; Phase 3 may run *after* Phase 4 if we're optimizing AI cost, but order written here is logical).
- **Normalize `publisher`** name — "nytimes.com" → "The New York Times", "wsj.com" → "The Wall Street Journal", "lex-fridman-podcast.simplecast.com" → "Lex Fridman Podcast".
- **Normalize `authors`** — split byline strings into individual authors, decide if "By Adam Grant" → `["Adam Grant"]` vs preserve "Adam Grant, Ph.D." style. Drop suffixes per house style.
- **Refine `default_slug`** — if Phase 1 used the hexcode fallback, generate a real slug from the now-known title.

**Failure modes:**
- Rate limit: backoff and retry; eventual fallback to Phase 2 candidates verbatim.
- Low confidence: emit field as-is from Phase 2 (raw OG meta), flag in warnings list.

### Phase 4 — AI classification (the most reasoning-heavy step)

- **`publisher_type`** — classify into the Train-Case taxonomy. Uses prompt caching to attach the Standards doc as context.
- **`tags`** — generate 3-7 Train-Case tags based on title + first 500 chars of content + publisher_type. Pull from existing tag corpus when overlap exists; introduce new tags sparingly.

**Failure modes:**
- Low confidence on `publisher_type` (< 0.7): set to `Other`, flag for human review.
- Tag generation timeout: emit empty array, flag.

### Phase 5 — Content archival (network + filesystem, no AI strictly required)

- **`downloaded_content_path`**: HTML save (`{citationsFolder}/_archive/{hexcode}.html`). For PDFs, save the binary. For paywalled, save the partial.
- **`structured_data_path`**: Run Jina.ai Reader → save the cleaned text as `.md` or pass through Claude for structured extraction → save as `.json`. *(TODO below — choice depends on downstream consumers.)*

**Failure modes:**
- Disk full: hard failure, surface immediately.
- Jina rate-limit: queue for retry; mark `structured_data_path` empty for now.

> **TODO (human):** Decide whether `structured_data_path` is a Markdown file from Jina (cheaper, lossy structured-ness) or a JSON file from a Claude tool-use extraction pass (more expensive, well-typed). Might be both: `.md` for human review, `.json` for downstream RAG ingest.

### Phase 6 — Validation

- Apply the **Source-Type Matrix** from the Standards doc against the assembled YAML.
- For each "Expected" field that's empty, emit a warning.
- For each "Not applicable" field that's filled, emit a warning (probable error).
- Check the Minimum-Viable Citation thresholds.
- Return: `{ valid, warnings, errors }` plus the final YAML.

## Output Contract

The agent's MCP-tool return shape:

```typescript
interface CanonicalizeCitationResult {
    success: boolean;                   // false only on hard failure (e.g., disk full, network out, Phase 1 bug)
    yaml: string;                       // the schema-conformant YAML body, ready to write into a citation file
    citation_file_path: string;         // where the file was written
    archive_paths: {                    // populated when Phase 5 succeeds
        downloaded?: string;
        structured?: string;
    };
    matrix_check: {                     // from Phase 6
        valid: boolean;                 // true = passes Minimum-Viable; false = warnings (still emits)
        warnings: string[];             // human-readable
        errors: string[];               // hard validation failures
    };
    phase_outcomes: {                   // for debugging / partial-success diagnosis
        deterministic: 'success' | 'error';
        fetch: 'success' | 'partial' | 'skipped' | 'error';
        normalize: 'success' | 'fallback' | 'error';
        classify: 'success' | 'low-confidence-other' | 'error';
        archive: 'success' | 'partial' | 'skipped' | 'error';
        validate: 'success' | 'warnings' | 'errors';
    };
}
```

> **AI agent note (output contract):** Emit valid YAML even when phases partially failed. The downstream consumer should be able to ingest the file and surface its own warnings. **Never return invalid YAML to silence a phase failure.**

## Trigger Model

The agent is invoked by clients in three ways. Each maps to a corresponding MCP tool.

### Trigger 1 — Per-citation, manual

- **Where:** "Promote to Canonical" button in the Citations modal (cite-wide plugin), or `canonicalize` CLI command on a specific hex.
- **Input:** existing hex ID (already in vault), or new URL to canonicalize from scratch.
- **Output:** writes/updates `Citations/{hex}.md` with full schema; reports per-phase outcomes back to the client.
- **User confirmation:** required before writing to disk (modal confirmation, CLI `--yes` flag).

### Trigger 2 — Bulk sweep

- **Where:** `Sweep Citations` command (cite-wide plugin) or `sweep` CLI subcommand.
- **Input:** folder path; optional filter (e.g., "only sources with `structured_data_path` empty").
- **Output:** processes citations in parallel (up to N concurrent, rate-limit-aware); reports aggregate statistics.
- **Idempotency:** see State section below.

### Trigger 3 — Capture-and-canonicalize

- **Where:** "Capture URL as Canonical Source" command (cite-wide plugin) or `capture` CLI subcommand.
- **Input:** URL.
- **Output:** generates new hex, runs full pipeline, writes `Citations/{hex}.md`. Skips the "already-exists" check that the modal-driven flow does.
- **Use case:** you're reading something in a browser, want to add it directly to the canonical archive without having referenced it in any vault doc yet.

> **TODO (human):** Should there be a fourth trigger for the Investment Memo Orchestrator's use case (look up a canonical source by URL or by content fingerprint, not by hex ID)? The orchestrator doesn't necessarily know the hex when it wants to attribute a claim.

## State, Idempotency, Resume

The agent's design assumption: **canonicalization can fail mid-pipeline and resume cleanly later.** This is critical for bulk sweeps and for sources behind flaky paywalls.

- **Persistence between phases:** the agent writes a `_canonicalize_state.json` per source (in the archive folder) tracking which phases succeeded. On resume, it skips phases marked `success`.
- **Re-canonicalization (idempotency):** running canonicalize on a source that already has full metadata is a no-op for filled fields. Empty/optional fields get re-attempted (a paywalled source might now be accessible; a tag corpus might have grown).
- **URL drift handling:** on re-fetch, if the URL redirects to a new location, `recently_accessed_at_url` updates to the new URL and `date_recently_accessed` updates to today. `first_accessed_at_url` never changes once set. If the new URL serves materially different content (heuristic: title diverged), flag for human review — this might be a different article entirely.
- **Hex collision on capture-and-canonicalize:** if a generated hex collides with an existing canonical, regenerate. Cap at 5 attempts; failure beyond that is a bug.

## Failure Modes & Graceful Degradation

| Failure | Severity | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Source URL 404/410 (dead link) | Low | Mark `recently_accessed_at_url` with prefix `DEAD:`; continue with cached data; flag |
| Source URL 403 / paywall | Low | Capture meta tags only; skip content download; flag |
| Source URL timeout | Low | Retry once; if still timing out, skip with flag |
| HTML parse failure (malformed) | Low | Use raw HTTP body for AI extraction; skip meta-tag phase |
| Claude API rate limit | Medium | Exponential backoff (max 3 retries); on persistent failure, skip phase and emit Phase 2 candidates verbatim |
| Claude API low confidence | Low | Use threshold (0.7); fallback to `Other` for `publisher_type`, raw values for normalization |
| Disk full | High | Hard error; surface to caller; do not write partial |
| Slug collision after disambiguation attempts | Medium | Use UUID-suffixed slug; flag for human review |
| Source content materially changed (drift detection) | Medium | Update `recently_accessed_at_url`; flag for human review (might be different article) |

> **AI agent note:** When emitting flags/warnings, use structured shape (level + message + field), not free-text. The CLI / plugin can then route warnings to the right place.

## Integration Hooks with the Existing Plugin

These are the seams in today's `cite-wide` codebase where the MCP-server pipeline plugs in. Listed for clarity, not as immediate work items.

- **`citationFileService.saveAllHexCitationsFromContent`** is today's "lite canonicalization" — it pulls reference text + URL, calls `createCitationFile`. The MCP server's `canonicalize_citation` tool **replaces** this for sources promoted past the lite tier.
- **`urlCitationService.extractCitationFromUrl`** (the Jina-based extract) is **still useful** — it's the cheap path for getting `title`, `authors`, `siteName`, `date_published` candidates. The MCP server should call it as part of Phase 2.
- **`CitationModal`** gains a **"Promote to Canonical"** button on hex groups (sibling to the existing "Save to Citations" button we just shipped). Promote = trigger MCP `canonicalize_citation` against the same hex. Save = today's lite write. The two coexist.
- **Settings** gains a `mcpServerUrl` field once the MCP server is in place. Default: localhost:port for solo use; team-shared URL when org KB lands.

## Open Decisions (TODOs)

- **TODO (human):** MCP-server-first architecture vs in-plugin-first — confirm. Lean: MCP-server.
- **TODO (human):** `structured_data_path` content type — Markdown (Jina), JSON (Claude tool-use), or both? Affects pipeline cost and consumer flexibility.
- **TODO (human):** Investment Memo Orchestrator's lookup pattern — by hex / URL / content fingerprint? Affects whether we need a fourth MCP tool.
- **TODO (human):** Bulk-sweep concurrency limits — how many sources in parallel? Throttle by rate limits (Claude API, Jina API), but the user-side concern is "don't burn the laptop."
- **TODO (human):** Where the MCP server runs — local-first (per-contributor laptop), or eventually a team-shared deployment? Affects auth, the `mcpServerUrl` setting, and the "communist KB" tier semantics.
- **TODO (AI):** Validate the Phase 2 meta-tag selectors against real-world sources. Phase 2 is the most empirically-driven phase; the listed selectors are a reasonable starting point but real sources have variants.
- **TODO (human + AI):** Pricing/cost model — at what canonicalize-volume does this become a noticeable line item? Per-source cost estimate is in the ballpark of $0.02-0.10. A 1000-source canonicalize sweep is $20-100. Worth surfacing in the CLI.
- **TODO (AI):** Error reporting taxonomy — current draft uses prose `string[]`. May want structured error codes once consumer tooling exists.
