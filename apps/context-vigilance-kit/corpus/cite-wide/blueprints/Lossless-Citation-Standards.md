> **How to read this doc.** Sections are grouped by audience: the **WHY** sections (Thesis, Portability Spine) are mandatory context for anyone — human or AI agent — touching the schema. The **WHAT** sections (Schema, Source-Type Matrix, Audiences) are the actual specification. The **HOW** is deferred to the two sibling docs.
>
> **For an AI agent reading this as prompt context:** read top-to-bottom on first pass; re-read the Source-Type Matrix per source you process. Do not invent fields. Do not omit Portability Spine fields. When you don't know a value, leave the field empty — never fabricate.

## Why Care? — The Portability Thesis

Citations in this system are not bibliographic decoration. They are the **interop anchor between three knowledge tiers** the Lossless Group is consciously building:

1. **Personal knowledge base** — what one contributor reads, captures, and references in their own working files.
2. **Organizational knowledge base** — the "communist-style" pool where any contributor can use any other contributor's captured content. Cross-vault, cross-project. All of our content belongs to all of us.
3. **Beyond-human-scale derived layers** — vector databases, RAG/KAG retrieval pipelines, fine-tuning corpora. The substrate that lets agentic systems (e.g. the Investment Memo Orchestrator we're building separately) reason from our accumulated context rather than from live web search alone.

The schema below is designed for the **third tier first**, even though most contributors only see the first two. A field like `first_accessed_at_url` looks like trivial bibliographic metadata when you're writing a blog post. It's a deduplication key when 300 documents reference the same article through different display URLs and a vector pipeline is trying not to triple-count the same source.

> **The unifying mental model:** treat content as data we intend to **keep, port, reuse, and continue to build out**. Every field exists because some downstream consumer — perhaps not yet built — will need it.

## The Portability Spine

Five fields are load-bearing for the cross-tier story. If a citation has these five, it can move between tiers without identity loss. Everything else is display, classification, or annotation.

| Field | Why it's spine |
|---|---|
| `internal_uuid` | The stable cross-system anchor. Survives vault renames, file moves, copy-paste between vaults, eventual migration into a structured database. UUID generation is mechanical; the *commitment* to having one at capture time is the architectural decision. |
| `first_accessed_at_url` | The original URL we retrieved from. Anchoring and attribution — what we cited the first time. Survives even when the source's URL drifts (slug rename, redirect, paywall move). |
| `recently_accessed_at_url` | The current URL when content has drifted. Lets a downstream agent or content-archive process know where to re-fetch. Often equals `first_accessed_at_url`; only diverges when drift is detected. |
| `downloaded_content_path` | The bit-preserving record. Even if the publisher takes the page down, the source we cited is still on disk. This is what makes our citations honest in a year. |
| `structured_data_path` | The contract that "the JSON-y form of this source exists somewhere reachable." Lets a downstream consumer (Investment Memo Orchestrator, vector DB ingest, etc.) skip re-fetching and re-extracting — pull from structured shape directly. |

Backfill priority for an existing Citations folder is always: spine first, everything else second. The spine fields unblock all downstream work; the rest is polish.

## Naming Conventions (load-bearing — apply consistently)

| Surface | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| YAML property names | `snake_case` (underscore) | `internal_uuid`, `default_slug`, `publisher_favicon_url` |
| `default_slug` value | `snake-case` / kebab-case (dash) | `vector-databases-2026-market-analysis` |
| `tags` values | `Train-Case` (capitalized words, dash-separated, no spaces) | `Vector-Databases`, `RAG-Pipelines`, `Investment-Memo` |
| `publisher_type` values | `Train-Case` from controlled taxonomy below | `Market-Research-Organization` |

Obsidian does not allow spaces in tags. We chose Train-Case (over kebab-case) for tag values so the tag taxonomy reads cleanly when humans browse it; we chose snake_case for properties because it's the YAML/Python idiom most consumers will expect.

## Audiences and Influences

Lossless citations need to render usefully into multiple downstream conventions. The schema is rendering-target-neutral — same data, different format depending on where the citation is consumed. The styles below are what we currently render into; new styles plug in by writing a new renderer over the same schema.

### Lossless House Style (default)

Our house style for footnote-form citations in Markdown. See `context-v/reminders/Lossless-Citation-Spec.md` for the inline-citation rules (`[^hexcode]` placement, spacing, reference-section formatting). The reference-line shape is:

```markdown
[^{hexcode}]: 2025, Jan 25. {Author Surname, First Name}. [Title of the source](url). Source Publisher Name || [Source Publisher Name](url). Accessed {Month Day, Year}.
```

Maps to the schema as: `date_published` (split into year/month/day), `authors[0]`, `title`, `recently_accessed_at_url` (what we link to), `publisher` (+ optional `publisher_url`), `date_recently_accessed`.

### Obsidian-Native

Default to GitHub Flavored Markdown + Remark/CommonMark conventions. Footnote syntax with `[^hexcode]` markers; reference definitions at the bottom of the file. Obsidian's autocomplete handles enum-like fields without us enforcing them. The Lossless House Style is a tightening of the Obsidian-native baseline.

### Academic Style

Renders to APA / MLA / Chicago / etc. Required fields beyond the spine: `authors` (full list, ordered), `date_published` (year minimum), `title`, `subtitle` (when journal/book has one), `publisher` (journal name, conference name, or book publisher), `edition_or_version` (for books, software, datasets). `lede` is not used; academic styles treat subtitle and abstract as separate concerns.

> **TODO (human):** Confirm which academic style is the default rendering target — APA seems most common in our market work; MLA appears in some humanities contributions. May want a per-document `citation_style_override` for sources that warrant non-default rendering.

### Market Analyst Style

The shape used in published research notes from research firms (Gartner, Forrester, Bloomberg Intelligence, McKinsey/BCG insights pieces, niche trackers like Pitchbook, Preqin, Crunchbase, SimilarWeb). Required: `publisher` (the firm), `publisher_type: "Market-Research-Organization"` or similar, `title`, `date_published`, often `authors` (analyst names matter). `subtitle` common; `lede` rare. Often paired with `api_provider_*` fields when the source is delivered via a data-as-a-service API rather than as a public webpage.

### Web-Ready Style

Magazine, blog, newsletter, social media, UGC. Required: `first_accessed_at_url`, `title`, `lede` (the magazine-style hook), `publisher` (the site name, normalized — "The New York Times" not "nytimes.com"), `publisher_favicon_url` (site renderers use it for visual cues), `piece_og_image` (for hero treatment). `subtitle` is rarely used here; `lede` replaces it.

> **TODO (human):** Decide whether `lede` is auto-generated from the first paragraph by AI when not present in OG metadata, or only ever populated when the source provides one. Consequences: AI-generated `lede` mixes our voice with the source's; source-only `lede` will be empty for most blog posts.

## Publisher and Publication Types

The `publisher_type` field is a controlled-but-not-enforced Train-Case taxonomy. It drives the **Source-Type → Field Applicability Matrix** below — different types call for different field subsets.

| `publisher_type` value | Definition | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `Academic-Journal` | Peer-reviewed scholarly publication | Nature, JFE, Quarterly Journal of Economics |
| `Academic-Working-Paper` | Pre-publication or non-peer-reviewed academic | NBER, SSRN, arXiv |
| `Market-Research-Organization` | For-sale industry research | Gartner, Forrester, IDC, Omdia |
| `Think-Tank` | Policy / strategy non-profit | Brookings, RAND, Council on Foreign Relations |
| `Government-Agency` | National or supranational government | BLS, ECB, OECD, World Bank |
| `Consulting-Firm` | Strategy/management consulting public output | McKinsey Quarterly, BCG Insights, Bain Reports |
| `Industry-Media` | Trade publications & news | TechCrunch, The Information, Bloomberg, FT |
| `Individual-Researcher` | Personal blog / Substack of a credentialed individual | Stratechery, Marginal Revolution, Eugene Wei |
| `Content-Creator` | YouTube, podcast, or platform-native creator | Lex Fridman podcast, AI Explained YouTube |
| `Social-Media-User` | Single-platform-resident author (no own site) | LinkedIn poster, Twitter/X user, Mastodon user |
| `Data-as-a-Service-Provider` | Source delivered primarily via API or paid platform | Crunchbase, Preqin, Pitchbook, SimilarWeb, Traxn |
| `Content-Marketing` | Vendor-published content with brand-promotion intent | Hubspot blog, AWS blog, vendor whitepapers |
| `UGC-Community` | User-generated discussion | Reddit thread, Quora answer, Stack Overflow post, Hacker News thread |
| `Other` | Doesn't fit cleanly elsewhere — flag for review | (used sparingly) |

> **AI agent note:** When you cannot confidently classify a source, use `Other` and surface the ambiguity to a human reviewer. **Do not guess** between two plausible types.

## Schema (full YAML)

The schema is grouped into logical sections below. **All fields are optional unless marked Required.** Empty strings and empty arrays are valid — leaving fields off is fine. The agent should not fabricate values to make a field present.

> **Read the YAML block below as an illustrative *example*, not a per-citation requirement.** Different citation types populate different property sets — see the Source-Type → Field Applicability Matrix later in this document for the per-type expectations. A real canonical citation file will fill some sections and leave others entirely off; that is the intended shape, not an incomplete one. The block exists to enumerate every field name and document its purpose in one place, not to suggest every citation should carry every field.

```

> **AI agent note (output contract):** Emit exactly the field names above. Do not introduce new fields without updating this spec. Do not fabricate values; emit empty strings or omit fields when the source-of-truth lookup fails. The pipeline doc specifies which lookup paths to try and in what order.

## Source-Type → Field Applicability Matrix

For each source type, this matrix lists fields that are **expected** (E), **optional** (O), or **not applicable** (—). The agent uses this to decide which fields to attempt and which to skip.

| Field \ Type | Acad-Journal | Acad-WP | Mkt-Research | Think-Tank | Gov-Agency | Industry-Media | Indiv-Researcher | Content-Creator | Social-Media | DaaS-Provider | Content-Marketing | UGC-Community |

| `tags` | E | E | E | E | E | E | E | E | E | E | E | E |

> **AI agent note:** "Expected" means: the agent must attempt to fill this field and surface a warning if it cannot. "Optional" means: fill if cheaply available; do not chase. "Not applicable" means: do not emit even if data is somehow available (it would be misleading on this source type).
>
> **Note on `recently_accessed_at_url`:** Always Optional in this matrix because the agent only fills it when URL drift is detected. On first capture, it equals `first_accessed_at_url` and may be omitted (renderers default to `first_accessed_at_url` when this is empty).
>
> **Human reviewer note:** Override the matrix at the per-source level if a specific source warrants a non-default field set (e.g. a Substack post that's structurally an academic working paper).

## Minimum-Viable Citation

For a citation to be considered **valid** (i.e. ingestible by downstream tooling without warnings), it must have:

- All five Portability Spine fields: `internal_uuid`, `first_accessed_at_url`, `recently_accessed_at_url` (may equal first), `downloaded_content_path`, `structured_data_path`. *(For ad-hoc citations not yet promoted to canonical, the two `_path` fields may be empty strings — the validator emits a warning but not an error.)*
- `title`
- `date_added`
- `publisher_type` (so the matrix above can be applied for further checks)
- `tags` non-empty (downstream search and clustering rely on tag presence)

A citation that lacks any of these is **incomplete** — usable in display contexts but not in the canonical archive. The acquisition pipeline (sibling doc) defines the agent's behavior when a minimum-viable threshold cannot be met.

## Relationship to the In-Code `CitationMetadata` Interface

The schema above is the **authoritative on-disk shape** for any citation promoted into the Citations folder. It is the reference for what canonical citations look like, what fields downstream consumers can rely on, and what shape the acquisition pipeline targets when it fills missing fields.

The `cite-wide` plugin also defines an in-code TypeScript interface, `CitationMetadata`, in `src/services/citationFileService.ts`. That interface is **not a competing schema** — it is a simplified operational projection used while the plugin is reading, writing, and managing citation files in memory. The current shape:

```ts
interface CitationMetadata {
    hexId: string;
    title: string | undefined;
    author: string | undefined;
    url: string | undefined;
    date: string | undefined;
    source: string | undefined;
    tags: string[];
    created: string;
    lastModified: string;
    referenceText: string | undefined;
    usageCount: number;
    filesUsedIn: string[];
}
```

This shape predates the full schema above and has not yet caught up. It is the gap between current implementation and current thinking — not an alternative tier the schema is meant to coexist with. Treat it as legacy-shaped; do not introduce new code that depends on its narrow shape.

### Known gaps to close as the interface evolves

The interface needs to grow toward the on-disk shape. Specific gaps:

| In-code field | Replace / extend with | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `author: string` | `authors: string[]` | Plural per the schema; even single-author sources go in an array. |
| `url: string` | `first_accessed_at_url`, `recently_accessed_at_url` | Splits to capture URL drift. |
| `date: string` | `date_published`, `date_added`, `date_recently_accessed` | The schema distinguishes three time concerns; the current single `date` collapses them. |
| `source: string` | `publisher`, `publisher_url`, `publisher_type`, `publisher_favicon_url` | The "source" concept gets unpacked into a small object. |
| (none) | `internal_uuid`, `default_slug`, `reference_hexcode` | Identity / spine fields not present today. |
| (none) | `downloaded_content_path`, `structured_data_path` | Spine fields for portability not present today. |
| (none) | `cited_excerpt`, `cited_location` | Document-grounded fields (deferred — see "Document-grounded citation fields" above). |
| `created`, `lastModified`, `referenceText`, `usageCount`, `filesUsedIn` | (operational; keep) | Plugin-internal bookkeeping. `filesUsedIn` corresponds to `cited_in_files` in the schema; the rest are operational and don't appear in the on-disk YAML. |

The evolution is incremental — each of these gaps can be closed in a separate change without breaking existing citation files (additive YAML reads back as missing fields, which the schema already permits).

> **Note:** The earlier "Big-bang vs Dual-shape vs Opt-in" migration framing has been retired. The schema is the target; the in-code interface migrates toward it field-by-field as the plugin is touched. New code should use the schema's field names directly when reading or writing YAML frontmatter, even if the in-memory interface still uses the legacy shape elsewhere.

## Open Decisions (TODOs)

These are the spec-level open questions. Each blocks some piece of the implementation but not the rest.

- **TODO (human):** Default academic rendering style — APA / MLA / Chicago / other? Allow per-document `citation_style_override`?
- **TODO (human):** `lede` auto-generation policy — only when source provides, or AI-generate when missing? Consequences: AI-generated `lede` mixes our voice with the source's; source-only `lede` will be empty for most blog posts.
- **TODO (human):** `tags` taxonomy governance — controlled vocabulary or organic growth with periodic consolidation passes? If controlled, where is the canonical list stored?
- **TODO (human + AI):** Migration model from current `CitationMetadata` — see Coexistence section. Lean: dual-shape.
- **TODO (AI):** Validate the Source-Type Matrix against real sources — first pass was reasoned-from-template; some cells need empirical checking. Particularly `Social-Media` and `UGC-Community` rows.
- **TODO (human):** Should `recently_accessed_at_url` always be present (mirror to `first_accessed_at_url` on first capture for symmetry), or only present on detected drift (current draft)?
- **TODO (AI):** When `subtitle` and `lede` data both seem present in source meta tags, what's the decision rule? Currently "by source type" via the matrix — but a tricky case is a magazine-style academic paper.
