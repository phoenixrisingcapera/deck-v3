# Graphify — Profile

A profile of Graphify as it lives in this study (`studies/memory-layers-for-agents/graphify/`). Cites pinned paths so you can jump to source rather than trust paraphrase. Read alongside [`Profile__Graphiti.md`](./Profile__Graphiti.md) and [`Profile__MemPalace.md`](./Profile__MemPalace.md) — Graphify makes a categorically different bet from both: the "memory" it gives the agent is not conversational history but the *static corpus the agent works against*, modeled as a single in-process knowledge graph.

## TL;DR

Graphify is an **AI coding assistant skill** that turns a folder — code, SQL schemas, R scripts, shell scripts, docs, papers, images, videos — into a queryable knowledge graph, then exposes that graph to the agent over **MCP** (`graphify/serve.py:1`). The agent calls `query_graph`, `get_neighbors`, `get_community`, `god_nodes`, `shortest_path` instead of grepping through files.

The pipeline is single-process and legible end-to-end (`ARCHITECTURE.md`):

```
detect()  →  extract()  →  build_graph()  →  cluster()  →  analyze()  →  report()  →  export()
```

Extraction is **tree-sitter for ~30 languages** (`graphify/extract.py:912-1186`, plus SQL/Julia/Fortran and many more registered later). Each extractor returns a strict `{nodes, edges}` dict validated by `graphify/validate.py` before being merged into a NetworkX graph. Clustering is **Leiden via graspologic** with a NetworkX-Louvain fallback (`graphify/cluster.py:48-76`). Every edge carries one of three **confidence labels** — `EXTRACTED` / `INFERRED` / `AMBIGUOUS` (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) — so the agent can reason about how much to trust each relation. Output is three files in `graphify-out/`: `graph.json` (the whole graph), `graph.html` (interactive viewer), `GRAPH_REPORT.md` (the highlights). Optional exports include Obsidian vault, Mermaid call-flow HTML, and a Cypher dump (`graphify/export.py:586`).

**One sentence:** *Graphify treats the project itself as the memory layer — tree-sitter-parsed nodes and edges, Leiden communities, confidence-labelled relations, single `graph.json` artifact, served to any MCP-speaking AI coding assistant via stdio.*

## Why this exists — the design bet

Three observations drive the design:

1. **The corpus is the agent's primary memory.** For coding agents, the question "what does this codebase look like" is asked far more often than "what did the user say last week." Existing memory layers (Mem0, Letta, MemPalace, Graphiti) optimize the second; Graphify optimizes the first.
2. **A graph DB is overkill for project-scale recall.** Graphiti expects Neo4j/FalkorDB/Kuzu/Neptune; MemPalace runs ChromaDB + SQLite. Graphify ships a single `graph.json` plus a NetworkX in-process graph and refuses to add a database. Project-scale graphs (tens of thousands of nodes) fit comfortably in RAM.
3. **MCP is the right interface, not a custom SDK.** Letta exposes an OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint; Graphiti exposes a Python library + optional MCP server. Graphify is **MCP-first** — the skill registration step (`graphify install`) wires the stdio server into Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Aider, and many more.

## Storage topology — one in-process graph, one JSON file

There is no database. The whole memory layer is:

- **In-process state:** a `networkx.Graph` (or `DiGraph`) built by `graphify/build.py:192`.
- **On-disk artifact:** `graphify-out/graph.json` — node-link JSON written by `graphify/export.py:475`. Re-opened by the MCP server via `networkx.readwrite.json_graph.node_link_graph` (`graphify/serve.py:13-30`).
- **Cache:** `graphify/cache.py` keeps a per-file stat index (size + mtime_ns + hash) so unchanged files skip re-extraction on subsequent runs — the same trade-off as `make(1)`.
- **Output dir override:** `GRAPHIFY_OUT` env var (`graphify/cache.py:13`) — supports worktrees and shared-output setups.

Python 3.10+ required (`pyproject.toml:13`). MIT-licensed (`LICENSE`).

This is the **opposite operational posture** from Graphiti (server-required, four pluggable graph DB backends) and even from MemPalace (ChromaDB + SQLite). Graphify denies the database premise and ships the graph as a file you can copy around.

## Extraction — tree-sitter per language, strict schema, three-level confidence

Every language extractor (`graphify/extract.py`) returns the same shape:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "unique_string", "label": "human name", "source_file": "path", "source_location": "L42"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "id_a", "target": "id_b", "relation": "calls|imports|uses|...", "confidence": "EXTRACTED|INFERRED|AMBIGUOUS"}
  ]
}
```

(`ARCHITECTURE.md`)

The **confidence label is load-bearing**:

- `EXTRACTED` — the relation is explicit in source (an import statement, a direct call).
- `INFERRED` — a reasonable deduction (call-graph second pass, co-occurrence in context).
- `AMBIGUOUS` — uncertain; surfaced in `GRAPH_REPORT.md` for human review.

This is the same idea Graphiti encodes in `episodes: list[str]` edge provenance, but cheaper — no LLM call needed to label confidence; it falls out of the parser pass.

Languages registered as `LanguageConfig` objects in `graphify/extract.py` include Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, Java, Groovy, C, C++, Ruby, C#, Kotlin, Scala, PHP, Lua, Swift, plus SQL, Julia, Fortran, and others added through the same dispatch pattern (`graphify/extract.py:912-1186` and downstream).

Adding a language is a five-step recipe documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (tree-sitter parse → walk nodes → register suffix → add fixture → write test). The pattern is shallow enough that a new language extractor is one PR, not a feature.

## Build & dedup — fold extractions into a single NetworkX graph

`graphify/build.py:192` (`build`) merges per-file `{nodes, edges}` dicts into a graph, normalising IDs (`_normalize_id`, line 54) and source paths (`_norm_source_file`, line 68). `deduplicate_by_label` (line 235) collapses obvious aliases before community detection.

`graphify/build.py:281` (`build_merge`) handles incremental merges so a cache-hit re-run only needs to fold in the changed files' extractions. `graphify/build.py:366` (`prefix_graph_for_global`) namespaces a single repo's nodes with a `repo_tag` prefix so multiple repos can be merged into a single global graph — the seed of the "everything I work on in one graph" use case.

## Clustering — Leiden, with a Louvain fallback

```python
from graspologic.partition import leiden
# ...
result = leiden(stable, **kwargs)
# Fallback: networkx louvain (available since networkx 2.7).
communities = nx.community.louvain_communities(stable, **kwargs)
```

(`graphify/cluster.py:48-76`)

A `community` attribute is written onto every node. Community IDs are stable across runs (`0 = largest community after splitting`, per `graphify/cluster.py:91`). Communities feed two downstream features: the `get_community` MCP tool, and PR-impact analysis ("which communities does this PR touch").

`_MIN_SPLIT_SIZE`, `_COHESION_SPLIT_MIN_SIZE`, and a majority-vote rule for reattaching excluded hubs (`graphify/cluster.py:81-158`) keep the partition readable instead of producing a long tail of tiny communities — the kind of fiddly heuristic you only write after staring at real outputs.

## Analyze — god nodes, surprising connections, suggested questions

`graphify/analyze.py` produces the structured analysis the report renders:

- `god_nodes(G, top_n=10)` (`graphify/analyze.py:85`) — most-connected nodes, the project's "central abstractions."
- `surprising_connections(...)` (line 107) — cross-file, cross-language, or cross-community edges scored by an explicit `_surprise_score` rubric (line 177). The intuition: same-folder edges are boring; long-distance edges might be where the architecture is leaking. This is closer in spirit to "what should I read next" than "what is the answer."
- `_cross_language(src_a, src_b)` (line 24) — explicit signal for edges that bridge language boundaries, surfaced as a distinct surprise category.

The report (`graphify/report.py`) renders these into `GRAPH_REPORT.md` alongside suggested questions an agent might ask.

## Recall surface — MCP tools, not a Python SDK

`graphify/serve.py:382` (`start_server`) boots a stdio MCP server. The tools exposed (`graphify/serve.py:433+`):

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `query_graph` | BFS or DFS search around a natural-language question, capped by token budget. `mode`, `depth`, `token_budget`, `context_filter` are all knobs. |
| `get_node` | Full details for a node by label or ID. |
| `get_neighbors` | Direct neighbours of a node, optionally filtered by relation. |
| `get_community` | All nodes in a community by community ID. |
| `god_nodes` | Top-N most connected nodes. |
| `graph_stats` | Node/edge/community/confidence summary. |
| `shortest_path` | Shortest path between two concepts, with `max_hops` cap. |
| `list_prs` / `get_pr_impact` / `triage_prs` | GitHub-aware: list open PRs with CI + review state + which graph communities they touch, assess blast radius before starting work. |

Two ranking knobs in the query path are worth flagging (`graphify/serve.py:55-58`):

```python
_EXACT_MATCH_BONUS = 1000.0
_PREFIX_MATCH_BONUS = 100.0
_SUBSTRING_MATCH_BONUS = 1.0
_SOURCE_MATCH_BONUS = 0.5
```

Hand-tuned constants — the same kind of "we stared at real outputs" residue visible in the clustering code. IDF weights for query terms are cached on the graph object (`graphify/serve.py:60+`).

The MCP transport hardening is worth a look on its own (`graphify/serve.py:352-355`): blank-line filtering on stdin to survive Claude Desktop and other clients that emit framing whitespace.

## Watch mode — staleness signalling, not push notifications

`graphify/watch.py` writes a flag file when files change under the watched root. The MCP server polls that flag (`graphify/serve.py:397` and surrounding) to know when its in-memory graph is stale. No file-system events propagated through the MCP transport — just "the graph on disk is older than the source" as a single bit. Cheap, correct, easy to reason about.

## Security model

`graphify/security.py` is the chokepoint for external input (`ARCHITECTURE.md`):

- URLs → `validate_url()` (http/https only) + `_NoFileRedirectHandler` (blocks `file://` redirects).
- Fetched content → `safe_fetch()` / `safe_fetch_text()` (size cap + timeout).
- Graph file paths → `validate_graph_path()` (must resolve inside `graphify-out/`).
- Node labels → `sanitize_label()` (strips control chars, caps 256 chars, HTML-escapes).

The HTML-escape on labels is specifically motivated as protection against an attacker who controls a source file injecting markup that lands in MCP tool output (`graphify/serve.py:260-263`, F-010). This is a class of issue that conversational-memory entries in the study don't have to think about — but a project-as-memory entry, where the corpus is by definition adversarial-tolerant, does.

## On-disk shape — `graph.json` as the canonical artifact

```
graphify-out/
├── graph.html        interactive viewer (filter / search)
├── GRAPH_REPORT.md   highlights: key concepts, surprises, suggested questions
└── graph.json        full graph — query anytime without re-reading files
```

The format is NetworkX's node-link JSON. `graph.json` is the source of truth; the HTML and the report are derived. The `Cypher` export (`graphify/export.py:586` — `to_cypher`) is a one-way dump for users who want to load the graph into Neo4j — explicitly *not* a dependency.

The "could a non-AI program parse it cleanly" check from the study's working questions is satisfied trivially here: `graph.json` is plain JSON, schema documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## How it compares to the rest of the study

| Dimension | Graphify | Graphiti | MemPalace | Mem0 | Letta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| What is the memory of? | Static corpus (codebase / docs) | Conversational episodes | Conversational chunks | User / session facts | Agent core context + archival |
| Storage primitive | NetworkX in-process + `graph.json` | Cypher graph DB (4 backends) | ChromaDB + SQLite | Vector + KV + optional graph | Postgres + pgvector |
| Server required? | No (stdio MCP) | Yes | No (embedded) | Either | Yes (FastAPI + Postgres) |
| Write trigger | `/graphify .` on the folder | Per Episode (LLM-extracted) | Per chunk (verbatim, no LLM) | Per turn (LLM-summarised) | Per turn (agent self-edits) |
| Recall API | MCP tools (`query_graph`, etc.) | Python lib + REST + MCP | Python lib | REST + Python lib | OpenAI-compatible + REST + WS |
| Confidence on edges | Per-edge label (EXTRACTED / INFERRED / AMBIGUOUS) | Per-edge episode provenance | n/a (verbatim) | n/a | n/a |
| Temporal model | None — it's a snapshot | Bi-temporal (`valid_at`/`invalid_at` × `created_at`/`expired_at`) | Per-chunk timestamps | Per-record updated_at | Per-message timestamps |
| Code-aware? | Yes (tree-sitter, ~30 langs) | No | No | No | No |

The cleanest pairing is **Graphify vs Graphiti**:

- Same primitive in spirit (typed knowledge graph), different premise about what the agent needs to remember.
- Graphiti expects you to *teach* the graph; Graphify expects to *derive* it from a corpus you already have.
- Graphiti's bi-temporal model is the headline; Graphify's confidence labels are the headline. Both are forms of provenance, but at different granularities.

The cleanest pairing on **operational posture** is **Graphify vs MemPalace**: both refuse the server-required default; both ship as a Python package; both treat the on-disk artifact (Chroma collections + SQLite, or `graph.json`) as the canonical state. The architecture stance is "the memory layer should be a file."

## Working-checklist answers

Per the study's reading rubric:

- **Storage topology.** In-process NetworkX graph + on-disk `graph.json`. No external DB.
- **Write policy.** Batch — re-run `/graphify` on the folder, cache skips unchanged files. Not append-only at the relation level; the graph is rebuilt and overwritten (with a backup-protection check, `graphify/export.py:34`).
- **Scopes & namespacing.** Per-folder graphs; multi-repo via `prefix_graph_for_global` (`graphify/build.py:366`). No user/session/agent scoping — the unit is the project.
- **Schema of a memory.** Strict `{nodes, edges}` dict, with `id`/`label`/`source_file`/`source_location` on nodes and `source`/`target`/`relation`/`confidence` on edges (`ARCHITECTURE.md`). Validated by `graphify/validate.py`.
- **Recall surface.** MCP tools — BFS/DFS query, neighbor lookup, community fetch, god nodes, shortest path. IDF + exact/prefix/substring/source-match scoring (`graphify/serve.py:55-58`).
- **Eviction & compaction.** None — rebuild model. Stale-cache flag via `graphify/watch.py` triggers a re-run.
- **Serialization on disk.** Plain NetworkX node-link JSON. Schema in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Cypher export available but optional.
- **Operational story.** Local-first. Stdio MCP server, no network listener, no database. One process, one folder, one `graph.json`.

## Pointers worth following

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — the seven-stage pipeline, the extraction schema, the security model.
- `graphify/extract.py:912-1186` — the `LanguageConfig` registry. Reading two or three of these in sequence is the fastest way to understand what a tree-sitter-based extractor actually does.
- `graphify/cluster.py:48-158` — Leiden with Louvain fallback, plus the empirical heuristics for community splitting and hub reattachment.
- `graphify/analyze.py:107-388` — the surprise-scoring rubric. Less obvious than god nodes; more interesting than god nodes.
- `graphify/serve.py:433+` — MCP tool declarations. Read these to see what the agent actually *asks* of the graph.
- `graphify/security.py` + `SECURITY.md` — the threat model. The fact that this exists at all is part of what distinguishes a project-as-memory entry from a conversation-as-memory entry.

## Open questions for the study

- Does the static-snapshot model break down at a certain repo size? `graph.json` for a 1M-LOC monorepo would not be small.
- How well does `prefix_graph_for_global` actually compose across repos in practice? A cross-repo "find me anyone calling this function" use case is where this stops being a single-folder tool and starts being a portfolio-of-projects memory layer — Lossless-shaped.
- How does the confidence-label discipline survive in the presence of LLM-driven extractors? At the moment everything is tree-sitter; an LLM-extracted edge would presumably default to `INFERRED` or `AMBIGUOUS`, but the policy is not explicit.
- The `triage_prs` / `get_pr_impact` tools are an interesting boundary — knowledge graph as input to *decision-making about future work*, not just recall. Worth watching whether other entries grow toward this surface.
