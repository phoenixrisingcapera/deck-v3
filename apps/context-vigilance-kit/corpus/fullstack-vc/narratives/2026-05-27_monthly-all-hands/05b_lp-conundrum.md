## What this slide is

The four-question LP-syndication pulse, surfaced as a dashboard. Either composes `Section__LPSyndicationPulse` directly (live), or renders as a static four-tile grid with the seeded baseline.

## Why it's here

Frames the "shared tension" the breakouts dig into. Showing the data BEFORE the breakouts makes the *why* of Track 2 ("Syndicate to VCs") and Track 3 ("Offer to LPs") obvious.

## What to surface

- The headline tension: LPs want more direct co-invest, most firms aren't running SPV/campaign processes
- The four data points side-by-side (engagement / frequency / SPV / direct demand)
- That the data is live on the session page

## Visual hierarchy suggestion

Two columns: left = framing prose, right = four mini-charts (one per question). For the three Booleans: small Yes/No bars. For the sliding-scale: a 1-4 histogram with median marker. Heavy use of `--color-accent` for the Yes/strong-frequency bars. Could compose `Section__LPSyndicationPulse` directly if it renders OK at deck scale — verify in all three modes.
