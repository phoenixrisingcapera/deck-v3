title: 'Churn: An AI content editor for the Internet has been missing.'
lede: Content Management Systems are an old paradigm, they are clunky, they are rarely
  where creatives develop content.  HTML and CSS need to marry Content Editors

image_prompt: A closeup view of a monitor, a laptop, and a mobile device. The laptop
  has a text editor, it looks like a markdown editor, a simple version of a document
  editor.  There is some text there, headers, etc. On the monitor and on the mobile
  the same text is rendered as a beautiful web page.  There are connecting lines from
  the laptop to the monitor and the phone

Why are we still using complex file formats?  [[Vocabulary/AI Models|AI Models]] and [[concepts/Explainers for AI/Code Generators|Code Generators]] all speak [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Standards/Markdown|Markdown]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/HTML|HTML]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/CSS|CSS]], even [[Vocabulary/Scalable Vector Graphics|Scalable Vector Graphics]]. 

We can use [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/HTML|HTML]] and [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/CSS|CSS]] for layout design.  We don't need [[organizations/Adobe|Adobe]] or [[Tooling/Creative/Affinity Design Suite|Affinity Design Suite]]. We need to make it a [[Vocabulary/Responsive Design|Responsive Design]] and publish it to the web anyway.  Emails and reports, fine okay. 

Markdown editors are growing like crazy: [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/Obsidian|Obsidian]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/Anytype|Anytype]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/CraftDocs|CraftDocs]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Advanced Documents/Logseq|Logseq]], 

Academic editors are well loved like [[Tooling/Productivity/Research Tools/Essayist|Essayist]], [[Tooling/Productivity/Research Tools/PapersApp|PapersApp]]

Open source text editors like [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/Helix|Helix]], [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Code Generators/Zed|Zed]].

Open source version control systems like [[Tooling/Products/Git|Git]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Gitoxide|Gitoxide]], [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Jujutsu|Jujutsu]].

We have open standards like [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Standards/WebGL|WebGL]], and [[Vocabulary/WebGPU|WebGPU]], 

We now have a next generation [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform]] framework to build [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform Applications]] with libraries like [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/wgpu|wgpu]].

# Features
## Aliases & Variants: defaults to plural, singular, acronym, acronym plural. 

## Table Enhancements
Can merge cells.

## Tag Management

Find and replace tag all over content library.
Tags have aliases treated as first class citizens.


## Backlink System

Anywhere on the filesystem, not just in the vault.  Paths referencing other files in the filesystem outside the vault are indicated as needing to have an array of viable paths.

The array of viable paths also determines where the document appears.  

Managed by an easy to use one click one view symlink system.

## Repository Inter-Transport


### Show, hide HTML, CSS
Apps and [[Vocabulary/Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions|Plug-ins,  Add-ons,  Extensions]]
Use [[Tooling/Software Development/Frameworks/Frontend/UI Frameworks/Tailwind|Tailwind]]

Only deal with [[projects/Emergent-Innovation/Standards/Markdown|Extended Markdown]].  Sytnax definer, to web components. 

Tasks with metadata
```md
- [ ] {by: Michael Staton, to: Tanuj R., date_assigned: 2025-04-26, date_completed: 2025-04-29 } Just get it done please!  That thing! 
```
### Terminal Emulator Interface
Embedded [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Integrations|AI Integrations]] for both [[concepts/Explainers for AI/AI Powered Content Generation|AI Powered Content Generation]] and [[Vocabulary/Web Development|Web Development]]. 

Build once play anywhere [[Vocabulary/Cross-Platform Applications|Cross-Platform Applications]] with [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Rust|Rust]] using [[Tooling/Software Development/Programming Languages/Libraries/wgpu|wgpu]] or [[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevTools/Tauri|Tauri]]

### Projects

### Tools, Programs, Code etc.
Write your own tools to manipulate text. 

#### Improve Section

#### Suggest Edits

1. Private notes
2. Variants
3. Versions
4. Variables: `Clone parent: git clone <parent-repo>`
5. Components
6. Section and Header IDs, Header Level IDs in the naming.  

## Context, IDs, Windows
So, if I'm writing about something, I want it to be connected to that something.  Yet, it doesn't need to appear over and over. 

### AST object IDs for sections, paragraphs


### Appearances

### Header syntactical mods for subheaders and subtitles
In markdown there are by default 6 levels of headers.  However, if you want to render a subheader or subtitle you can use syntax to render the remaining text in as a subheading, subtitle, or lede.  For example, 

1. a double pipe (||)
2. a double dash (--)
3. a double colon (::)
4. a double asterisk (**)
5. a double equals (==)
6. a double plus (++)
7. surrounded by parenthesis (Heading (Text))


[[Tooling/Software Development/Developer Experience/DevOps/Jujutsu|Jujutsu]] integration.

Auto path and backlink adjustment on changes in files.

[[uuid]] generation
Split markdown file into two.
