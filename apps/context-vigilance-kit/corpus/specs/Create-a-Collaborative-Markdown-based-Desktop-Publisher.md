There is a gap in the existing tools – the ability to create truly custom Markdown with a high degree of control and flexibility, and the desire for a native, cross-platform experience.  Let’s break down how you might approach this, considering your web development background and the requirements for a desktop publishing-like editor.

Here’s a breakdown of the key challenges and potential architectural choices, focusing on a native, cross-platform approach:

**1. Core Architecture – A Hybrid Approach**

*   **Foundation: Rust's Core:** You’ll be leveraging Rust’s core features – its memory safety, concurrency, and ownership system – to build a robust and reliable Markdown parser and editor.
*   **Markdown Parser (Rust):**  A custom parser that can handle the complexities of Markdown, including:
    *   **Extensible Syntax:**  Crucially, you need to design a system where the *user* can define custom Markdown syntax. This is where your “desktop publishing” elements come in. Think about a modular system – a base syntax set, and then allow users to build on that with custom elements.
    *   **Rendering Engine:**  You'll need a system to interpret the user's custom syntax and render it into HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
*   **Component Library:** A system for building components – the base HTML elements, CSS, and Javascript that make up a piece of Markdown.
*   **Rendering Engine (Rust):** This is the core of the editor’s visual presentation. You’ll need a rendering engine capable of handling complex layouts, CSS, and Javascript.

**2. Key Features & Technologies**

*   **Declarative UI:**  This is *critical*.  Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, you’ll use declarative UI components (think React, Vue, or even a simplified version of a web UI framework). This allows you to define the *structure* of the document and the rendering engine will handle the presentation.
*   **JavaScript for Dynamic Behavior:**  JavaScript will handle user input, manage the rendering engine, and potentially implement some custom Markdown features.
*   **CSS for Styling:**  CSS will be used extensively for styling, providing a level of control over the look and feel.
*   **Custom Markdown Syntax (The Heart of Your Idea):**
    *   **Plugin System:**  A robust plugin system is essential. Users should be able to create plugins that extend the Markdown syntax. This is where the “custom syntax” idea comes in.
    *   **Syntax Definition Language (Optional):**  You *could* consider a simple DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to define custom syntax.  This would help with maintainability.
*   **Rendering Engine Choice:** Consider a framework like LitElement or similar, or a more complex custom rendering system.
*   **Cross-Platform:** This is the biggest challenge.  You'll need to leverage Rust's cross-platform capabilities.  This might involve:
    *   **WebAssembly (WASM):**  You could compile parts of your editor into WASM for better performance and to leverage Rust's compilation capabilities.
    *   **Containerization (Docker):**  Wrap your editor in a Docker container for consistent builds across different platforms.

**3. Leveraging Your Web Development Background**

*   **Rust’s Familiarity:** Your existing web development experience is a huge asset.  You'll be able to leverage your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and asynchronous programming.
*   **Focus on the Core:**  Don’t try to build *everything* at once. Start with the core Markdown parsing and rendering engine.

**4.  Desktop Publishing Style Considerations**

*   **Layout Engine:** Implement a layout engine that allows the user to define the structure of the document using CSS and Javascript.
*   **Advanced Styling:**  Provide tools for advanced styling, such as:
    *   **Themes:**  Allow users to customize the appearance of the editor.
    *   **Component Libraries:** A way to define reusable components.
*   **Interactive Elements:**  Consider adding interactive elements, such as:
    *   **Hyperlinks:** Allow users to link to external resources.
    *   **Tables:**  Enable users to create tables with formatting options.

**5.  Development Process**

*   **Iterative Development:** Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  Focus on the core Markdown parsing and rendering engine.
*   **User Feedback:** Get feedback from early users to refine the editor's features and UI.

**Resources to Start With:**

*   **Rust Documentation:** [https://doc.rust-lang.org/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
*   **LitElement:** [https://lit-element.dev/](https://lit-element.dev/) (A popular UI framework for Rust)
*   **Rust WebAssembly (WASM):** [https://wsoa.dev/](https://wsoa.dev/)

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:**

*   What specific aspects of a desktop publishing-like editor are you most interested in replicating? (e.g., complex layouts, advanced styling, a visual editing experience?)
*   What's your preferred level of complexity for the initial MVP? (e.g., just a basic Markdown parser, or a more complete editor?)

Okay, that’s *extremely* helpful and gives me a much clearer picture of your vision. You’re hitting on some really key points – the need for a flexible, editor-like experience, the desire for a polished, visual output, and the target audience's needs. Let’s refine this concept with those constraints in mind.

Here’s a slightly expanded breakdown of the design, incorporating your observations:

**1. Core Concept - Drawer/Panel Layout:**  You’re right – the drawer/panel structure is absolutely vital. It needs to feel like a focused workspace, not a cluttered, overwhelming environment.  We’ll lean heavily on the “code editor” feel, but with a markdown-centric focus.

**2. Left Column (Tools & File Navigator):** This is your core Markdown interface – basic syntax highlighting, search, and file management. Think a simplified version of Obsidian's quick-access features.

**3. Markdown Editor (Top Panel - Core):**  This is where the “custom syntax” builder comes in.  It will be a *visual* editor, not a text-based one.  We’ll use a system of nodes and relationships to represent Markdown syntax.  The goal isn’t to *replace* Markdown, but to *extend* it.  Think of it as a visual scripting layer.  Key aspects:
    * **Node-Based Syntax:** Each Markdown element (heading, paragraph, list, etc.) would be represented as a node.
    * **Custom Node Creation:**  Users will be able to create new nodes and connect them with custom rules.  This is the *key* to the “desktop publishing” feeling.
    * **Node Templates:**  Pre-defined templates for common Markdown structures (e.g., a “paragraph” node with customizable styling).

**4. Bottom Panel (Custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript):** This is the “rendering engine.”  It’s not a full-blown web framework, but a system for:
    * **Component Library:** Pre-built components (buttons, tables, lists, etc.) that users can easily incorporate.
    * **Declarative Rendering:**  Users will define the *structure* of the document using a visual language.  This will be the most crucial part.  It needs to be intuitive, even for non-developers.
    * **Layering System:**  A visual way to apply CSS and JavaScript styles to different parts of the document.

**5. Right Panel (Preview):**  A real-time preview of the document as the user edits.  This is vital for design-focused users.

**6.  "Custom Syntax" Builder – The Heart of the Experience:**  This isn't just a simple editor.  It's a visual system where users can:
    * **Create custom rules:** Define how Markdown elements should be rendered.
    * **Apply styles:**  Easily change colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual properties.
    * **Re-arrange nodes:**  The visual editor should make it easy to reposition and modify the structure.

**7. User Experience – For Designers/Content Marketers:**
    * **Drag-and-Drop:**  For arranging nodes and components.
    * **Context-Sensitive Tools:**  Toolbars that are relevant to the current node or element.
    * **Undo/Redo:**  Essential for making edits.
    * **Collaboration:**  (Optional) A way for multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously.

**Key Considerations for the Audience:**

*   **Ease of Use:**  The editor must be incredibly intuitive, even for users who aren’t familiar with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
*   **Flexibility:**  The system needs to be adaptable to a wide range of Markdown formats.
*   **Performance:**  Rendering large documents should be efficient.

**To help me further refine this, could you tell me:**

*   Are there any specific visual elements or features that you envision for the "custom syntax" builder that would be particularly appealing to designers/content marketers? (e.g., visual scripting, drag-and-drop?)
*   What’s the approximate scale of the initial MVP? (e.g., a single, focused Markdown editor, or a more comprehensive editor?)

Refinement for Designers/Content Marketers

Palette/Library: Provide a library of pre-made styles that designers can easily use.
Theme Support: Allow users to create and share themes.
Template System: Templates for common layouts.
Why this is better for the audience:

Visual, not Text-Driven: It’s a visual system, which is far more intuitive for designers.
Layered, Not Just Keyword-Driven: The layering system makes it easier to understand the relationships between elements.
Rule-Based: The rule-based system allows for powerful customization.
