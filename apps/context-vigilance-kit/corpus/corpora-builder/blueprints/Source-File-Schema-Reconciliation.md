# Source-File Schema Reconciliation

> The first artifact of [[Corpora-Builder-System-Design]]'s **Tension 1, Option B** — *"the canonical `corpus.ts`-descended domain model, the `source.*` verb vocabulary, the frontmatter schemas … shipped as copy-from sample code the siblings adopt knots-style."* Written now, ahead of corpora-builder having surfaces of its own, because a third app just shipped a source-capture surface and the window to converge is closing.

## Why now

memopop shipped a source-approval surface on 2026-08-06 that fetches page content via Jina, shows it, and **throws it away**. Fixing that means writing a source file — and the moment it writes one, memopop becomes the third generation of a schema that already exists twice. Either the three converge now or we get the same three-bucket truce the reach-edu corpus is already living with (`clients/reach-edu/corpus/AGENTS.md`).

## What already agrees (the good news)

Nobody has to be talked out of anything. The three implementations converged independently because they descend from the same constraints:

| Concept | augment-it `content-ingest/src/corpus.ts` | memopop `agent-skills/source-with-extracts-md` | strategy-curator `src/types.ts` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Filename | `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<title-slug>.md` | `<date>_<query-slug>/` + `<title-slug>.md` | `source_slug` (the on-disk stem) |
| When we pulled it | `fetched_at` | `fetched_at` | — |
| When it was published | `published_at` *(lifted out of Jina preamble to top level)* | `published_at` | `published_date` |
| Dedup identity | — | `normalized_url` | `normalized_url` |
| Lifecycle | — | `status: candidate → promoted → archived\|rejected` + `content_pulled` | `status: metadata-only \| fetched` + `content_pulled` |
| Provenance | `pack_id`, `captured_from` | `origin`, `search_query`, `engine` | — |
| Miscellany | `extra_metadata: {}` | *(flat fields)* | — |
| Binary sibling | `binary_asset{}` + `download_status` *(recorded even on failure)* | `asset_path` | `binary_filename`, `binary_bytes` |
| Collision | `_<suffix>` on the stem | — | — |

Four things are effectively settled and should be treated as givens:

1. **Files are the truth.** Markdown + YAML frontmatter; SurrealDB and Chroma index it. Triage is a `git mv` plus a frontmatter edit. (Constraint 1 of the system design.)
2. **`fetched_at` ≠ `published_at`.** When we pulled it is not when it was written. Both matter; conflating them makes staleness unanswerable.
3. **Two-tier fetch.** Cheap metadata + short excerpt on capture; full body or PDF only on promote. Never pay for content on a candidate that may be rejected.
4. **Aboutness over publisher.** The filing slug answers *what is this about*, not *who published it*. Membership is by tag and reconstructed by query, never by nesting. (Constraint 5.)

## What disagrees (the actual work)

Three real divergences, not stylistic:

**D1 — Lifecycle vocabulary.** `metadata-only | fetched` (strategy-curator) vs `candidate | promoted | archived | rejected` + `content_pulled` (memopop). These encode different things: the first is *how much have we pulled*, the second is *where is this in the analyst's decision*. **Both are needed and they are orthogonal.** Collapsing them is the mistake.

**D2 — Flat fields vs `extra_metadata`.** augment-it pushes unknown Jina/OG keys into `extra_metadata: {}` and lifts `published_at` out of it. memopop keeps everything flat. Flat reads better by hand; the catch-all survives upstream metadata changing shape.

**D3 — Provenance vocabulary.** `pack_id` / `captured_from` (a pack fired) vs `origin` / `search_query` / `engine` (a search surfaced it). Same question — *how did this get here* — different capture mechanics.

## The canonical set

Required is deliberately tiny. Everything else degrades gracefully; a file with only `url` is valid.

```yaml

# --- identity (url required; normalized_url is the dedup key) -------------
url: https://www.ocean-energy-systems.org/news/iea-oes-releases-annual-report/
normalized_url: ocean-energy-systems.org/news/iea-oes-releases-annual-report

```

### Three rulings worth stating plainly

**Keep both lifecycle axes (D1).** `status` is the analyst's decision; `content_pulled` is how much we have on disk. A source can be `promoted` with `content_pulled: false` (promote queued, fetch pending) or `candidate` with content already cached. One field cannot express that.

**Flat for the known set, `extra_metadata` for the rest (D2).** Every field above is flat and hand-editable. Unrecognized Jina/OG keys land in `extra_metadata` rather than polluting the top level. `published_at` is lifted out of it because sort/filter UIs read it as first-class — augment-it already does exactly this in `liftPublishedAt`.

**`verdict` is a person; `machine_verdict` is a machine.** memopop learned this the expensive way on 2026-08-06: ImmuneCo carried 34 verdicts reading `HTTP 200 (body verified)`, which are *reachability* results. Counting them as approvals is the precise category error the whole membership-gate effort exists to correct — **reachability is not approval**. Two fields, permanently.

## Filename and layout

```
<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>.md          # slug from title; falls back to the URL when untitled
<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>_<n>.md      # collision suffix
<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>.<ext>       # binary sibling, named to match its markdown
```

Where the file *sits* stays app-specific and that is fine — augment-it files under `clients/<client>/corpus/<domain-slug>/`, memopop under a per-search folder with a `_search.md` manifest. The **filename grammar** and the **frontmatter** are the contract; the directory tree is each app's business, because it encodes that app's tenancy model.

## Extracts stay out of YAML

Quotes, stats, and claims are punctuation-heavy strings full of `: " $ % [ ] |` — every character that breaks YAML. They live in the **body** as Lossless Flavored Markdown container directives under `# Extracts`, sectioned `## Quotes` / `## Claims` / `## Stats` / `## References`. The parse *is* the extraction, so there is no second structured copy to keep in sync. Carried forward verbatim from `source-with-extracts-md`; adopters must not re-invent this as YAML.

## Adoption rule

**Copy-from, knots-style. Not a package.** `corpora-builder/README.md` states it: *"corpora-builder does not become a shared dependency of the other ai-labs apps — patterns travel knots-style (blueprints + copy-from sample code), not as an npm package the siblings import."* A shared library across a Python orchestrator, a Node service, and a Tauri app would be three bindings and a release cadence nobody wants.

This blueprint is the contract. Each app owns its writer:

| App | Writer | Adoption |
|---|---|---|
| augment-it | `services/content-ingest/src/corpus.ts` | rename toward canonical; keep `extra_metadata` as-is |
| memopop | *(unwritten — the gap)* | write `src/curation/source_file.py` to this schema |
| corpora-builder | reference implementation | the copy-from source of record |

Divergence is allowed when an app genuinely needs it — but it gets **documented here**, not invented silently. That is the difference between a convention and a truce.

## Open questions

1. **Who owns `normalized_url` normalization?** memopop already has `canonical_url()` in `src/curation/best_sources.py` (lowercase host, drop `www.`, strip tracking params, collapse http/https). Is that the canonical algorithm, or does the JS side have its own? They must not disagree, or dedup silently fails across apps.
2. **Does `domains` belong here yet?** Generation A ⊎ B reconciliation is unresolved (Tension 2). The field is reserved above; the *semantics* wait on the domain-model spec.
3. **`source_uuid`.** strategy-curator carries one from a shared sources registry; memopop has no registry. Adding it to files before the registry exists would write a field nothing can resolve. Deferred until W4's tenancy tiers land.
4. **Does the excerpt length stay 200 chars?** Cheap enough to raise; the number is arbitrary and untested against how analysts actually triage.
