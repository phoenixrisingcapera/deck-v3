<!--
  TEMPLATE — copy, don't edit in place. The leading underscore keeps this file
  out of the ledger's glob, so its example IDs are never counted as promises.

  The one thing that makes a spec runnable-against is the `## Tests` table.
  Everything else here is the usual context-vigilance shape.
-->

# <Spec Name>

## Why Care?

<The problem this solves and what breaks without it. Concrete over abstract —
name the failure that motivated the spec, ideally one that actually happened.>

## Scope

**In:** <what this spec covers>

**Out:** <what it deliberately does not, and where that lives instead>

## Behaviour

<Numbered prose describing what the system does. Observable outcomes, not
implementation. This is what the test table below is derived from — if a
behaviour here has no test, either it isn't really promised or the table is
incomplete.>

## Tests

<!--
  RULES — these are enforced by scripts/spec_status.py, not by good intentions.

  · IDs are `<STEM>-<NN>`, uppercase stem, two-digit-or-more tail.
  · IDs are STABLE FOREVER. Never renumber — renumbering silently orphans every
    @pytest.mark.spec marker pointing at the old name.
  · Retire an ID by striking it (`~~STEM-04~~`) and saying why in the row.
    Never reuse a retired ID.
  · Write OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOUR. "then a file exists at <path> with <field>"
    survives a rewrite; "then it calls normalize_url()" does not.
  · NO Status column. Status is derived by running the ledger. A hand-written
    status is a lie waiting to happen.
  · An ID here with no @pytest.mark.spec("<ID>") test is MISSING and fails the
    build. That is deliberate: a promise with no test is the one failure mode
    that looks like success.

| ID | Given / When / Then |
|---|---|
| `STEM-01` | Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <observable outcome> |
| `STEM-02` | Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <observable outcome> |
| `~~STEM-03~~` | Retired YYYY-MM-DD — <why; where the behaviour went instead> |

## Acceptance

`uv run python ../scripts/spec_status.py --spec <This-Spec-Stem> --require-green`
exits 0, and the operator has walked the surface (Gate 4).
