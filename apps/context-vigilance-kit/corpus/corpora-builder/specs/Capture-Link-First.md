# Capture, Link-First

## Why Care?

This is the phase the project was asked for. The operator's words, at the point
the whole thing was still three design documents:

> *"I just want to get something running as I keep running into the need to
> create corpora."*

Phases 1 and 2 are plumbing — bytes at keys, and a parser that does not lie.
This is the first command that is useful on its own, and after it every later
phase is improvement rather than prerequisite.

## Scope

**In:** `corpora add <url>`; fetching metadata and optionally body; the
two-tier gate; dedup by `normalized_url`; filing under a domain or into the
inbox; binary siblings; recording failures as facts.

**Out:** file-first capture with link recovery (Phase 5); triage and promotion
(a source lands as `candidate` and nothing here promotes it); checkpointing
(Phase 4); anything that edits an existing source file — which is what defers
`Source-File-Model`'s open question 0 one more phase, since this command only
ever creates.

## Behaviour

1. `corpora add <url> --domain <type>/<slug>` writes one source file at
   `live/<type>/<slug>/sources/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<title-slug>.md`.
2. **Two-tier by default.** A bare `add` writes metadata only — title,
   publisher, `published_at`, a short excerpt — and sets `content_pulled:
   false`. `--fetch` pulls the full body and sets it true.

   This is the origin lesson of the tree, not a performance tweak: augment-it
   exists because bulk AI enrichment went haywire. Gate every enrichment step;
   spend grounding cost on survivors, never on candidates.
3. **Dedup by `normalized_url`.** If a source with the same normalised URL
   already exists in the target, no second file is written and the command
   reports the existing path.
4. **A failure is a fact.** An unreachable URL still writes a file, with the
   failure in `machine_verdict` and `content_pulled: false`. A source that
   404s is information — it is how you learn a citation rotted.
5. **Nothing here writes `verdict`.** Reachability is not approval, permanently.
6. With no `--domain`, the source lands in `live/inbox/`. The inbox is
   capture-first staging and the richest bucket, not a cleanup queue.
7. A URL that resolves to a PDF is **filed into the content-addressed `bin/`
   store**, optimized where that is safe, and the markdown records a pointer to
   it — `binary_key`, both digests, both sizes, and `download_status`. Recorded
   **even when the download failed**, because absence cannot distinguish "never
   tried" from "tried and got a 403".

   > **Amended 2026-08-22.** Until now the PDF landed as a *sibling* beside the
   > markdown, sharing its stem. That is what made binaries 90.5% of the corpus
   > bytes, forced Git LFS, and through LFS let `jj` corrupt a client repo. The
   > binary now lives once, addressed by its own hash, per
   > [[Binary-Ingest-And-Bin-Store]]. `CAPTURE-09` is retired rather than
   > reworded — it promised a different thing, and the promise changed.
8. Fetching is behind an injectable interface. The test suite performs no
   network I/O; a live fetch is a gated, deliberate run like `STORE-14`.

## Tests

| ID | Given / When / Then |
|---|---|
| `CAPTURE-01` | Given a reachable URL and a domain, when `add` runs, then a file exists at `live/<type>/<slug>/sources/<date>_<title-slug>.md` carrying `url`, `fetched_at`, and `status: candidate` |
| `CAPTURE-02` | Given a URL whose normalised form already exists in the target, when `add` runs again, then no second file is written and the existing path is reported |
| `CAPTURE-03` | Given a URL that cannot be fetched, when `add` runs, then a file is still written, `machine_verdict` records the failure, and `content_pulled` is false |
| `CAPTURE-04` | Given no `--fetch`, when `add` runs against a page with a long body, then only an excerpt is stored and `content_pulled` is false |
| `CAPTURE-05` | Given `--fetch`, when `add` runs, then the full body is stored below the frontmatter and `content_pulled` is true |
| `CAPTURE-06` | Given no domain, when `add` runs, then the source lands under `live/inbox/` |
| `CAPTURE-07` | Given any fetch outcome whatsoever, when `add` runs, then `verdict` is empty — no machine result is ever promoted to an analyst verdict |
| `CAPTURE-08` | Given a URL with tracking params and a `www.` host, when `add` runs, then `normalized_url` is the canonical form while `url` keeps exactly what was passed |
| `~~CAPTURE-09~~` | Retired 2026-08-22 — binaries no longer land as siblings beside their markdown. Superseded by `CAPTURE-17`; the storage model moved to [[Binary-Ingest-And-Bin-Store]] |
| `CAPTURE-10` | Given a PDF URL whose download fails, when `add` runs, then `binary_asset` is still recorded with a failing `download_status` and **no object is stored** |
| `CAPTURE-11` | Given a page whose body exceeds the excerpt cap, when `add` runs without `--fetch`, then the excerpt is truncated to the cap |
| `CAPTURE-12` | Given a target already holding a file with the same name from a different URL, when `add` runs, then the new file gains a `_2` suffix rather than overwriting |
| `CAPTURE-13` | Given a fetch that succeeds, when `add` runs, then `origin` records how the source arrived and `fetched_at` is an ISO-8601 UTC instant |
| `CAPTURE-14` | Given Jina's real response shape, where preamble lines are blank-line separated and the body follows a `Markdown Content:` marker, when it is parsed, then the preamble keys are extracted and the body begins after the marker |
| `CAPTURE-15` | Given a body opening with skip-links and a nav list, when an excerpt is taken, then it starts at the first real prose and carries no markdown link syntax |
| `CAPTURE-16` | Given a newly captured source, when it is written, then it states `status` and `content_pulled` explicitly rather than relying on a reader's defaults |
| `CAPTURE-17` | Given a URL serving a PDF, when `add` runs, then the bytes are stored once in `bin/` at their content hash and the markdown carries `binary_key`, `binary_sha256`, `binary_bytes`, `source_sha256`, `source_bytes` and `optimized` — with **no sibling written beside it** |
| `CAPTURE-18` | Given the same PDF captured into two different domains, when both are added, then one `bin/` object exists and both markdown files point at the same `binary_key` |

**Not in the automated suite, run deliberately:** a live fetch against a real
URL, writing into the dev bucket. Gated behind `CORPORA_LIVE_FETCH=1`, like
`STORE-14` and `CORPUS-01`. Mocked HTTP proves the code shape; it says nothing
about what Jina returns for a real page.

## Acceptance

```
uv run python scripts/spec_status.py --spec Capture-Link-First --require-green
```

exits 0, `bash scripts/check.sh` passes its blocking rungs, and the operator has
added a real link to a real corpus and looked at the file (Gate 4).

## Open questions

1. **Which fetcher?** Jina (`r.jina.ai`) is what augment-it and memopop both
   use, and its preamble carries title and published date. Behind the interface,
   so a second implementation is additive.
2. **Excerpt cap of 200 characters** — inherited from the blueprint, still
   untested against how an analyst triages. Unchanged, still open.
3. **Should `add` ever create the domain it files into?** For now yes,
   implicitly, because refusing to file a source because a folder does not exist
   is friction with no safety benefit. Revisit if domains grow a definition file
   that matters.
