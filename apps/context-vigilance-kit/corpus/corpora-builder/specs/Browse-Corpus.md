# Browse Corpus

## Why Care?

The plan put every surface at Phase 7 behind a Tauri shell. That sequencing was
the agent's, not the operator's, and it produced four phases of terminal output
for someone who said plainly: *"I'm waiting for a UI I can use."*

A Tauri app was never the cheapest way to a first screen. A FastAPI server and
one served page reuse the storage seam, the model, and capture exactly as they
are. Tauri remains available; it stops being the gate.

The first screen is **read-only against the local corpus** for two reasons.
reach-edu already holds 892 files representing real work the operator cannot
currently see well — so there is something worth looking at on the first load,
rather than an empty state. And read-only cannot damage a client corpus, which
means the screen can ship before the triage-and-rewrite questions are settled.

## Scope

**In:** listing sources under a prefix with their parsed metadata; filtering by
domain directory; free-text search over title and excerpt; opening one source's
raw text; surfacing damaged files rather than hiding them; a served page.

**Out:** every kind of write — no capture, no triage, no promotion, no edit.
Authentication (a localhost surface for one operator). R2 (the seam makes it a
config change when wanted). Tauri packaging.

## Behaviour

1. `corpora serve [--local <dir>]` starts a local HTTP server and prints its URL.
2. `GET /api/sources` returns every source under a prefix with `path`, `title`,
   `status`, `content_pulled`, `published_at`, `excerpt`, and its domain folder.
3. **A damaged file appears in the listing with its error**, never omitted. The
   ImmuneCo failure was 13 sources being silently absent from a count; a browse
   screen that drops what it cannot parse repeats exactly that.
4. `GET /api/source?path=` returns one source's raw text, unmodified.
5. Search matches title and excerpt, case-insensitively.
6. Listing is sorted newest-`fetched_at` first, because the question a corpus
   browser answers most often is "what did I just add".
7. The server writes nothing, ever. It opens the store read-only in the sense
   that no handler calls `write` or `delete`.

10. **A row says whether its binary is here.** A source with a `binary_key`
    carries it, plus whether the bytes are on this machine. Absent is a state —
    `not_downloaded` — with everything needed to get it, never an error and never
    a silent fetch (`Binary-Ingest-And-Bin-Store` Behaviour 8).

11. **The change feed is a read endpoint like any other.** `/api/changes`
    returns the structured record from [[Corpus-Change-Feed]], so the screen and
    the CLI render the same data through different surfaces rather than growing
    two notions of what changed.

12. **Fetching a binary is the one read that writes — to the cache, never the
    store.** It is allowed on a read-only server, because populating a local
    cache from an immutable object cannot alter the corpus. This is the
    exception that proves the rule in Behaviour 7, and it is stated so nobody
    later "fixes" it by gating it behind `--writable`.

13. **Opening the app must not read the whole corpus.** `/api/meta` needs a
    count and a domain list, both derivable from keys alone; it reads no file
    bodies. And an unsearched listing pages over **keys** before reading, so
    showing 50 rows costs 50 reads rather than 845. Measured cold against
    reach-edu on R2, the old path took **20.6 seconds** to answer `/api/meta` —
    which is what the operator saw as a window stuck on *Starting the backend…*

    Ordering is by the filename's date prefix rather than `fetched_at` when
    paging this way. The convention writes that date *from* `fetched_at`, so the
    two agree; where a file predates the convention it sorts by name, which is
    the honest fallback. A **search** still reads everything, because it has to,
    and a search is a deliberate act rather than a page load.

## Tests

| ID | Given / When / Then |
|---|---|
| `BROWSE-01` | Given a store holding source files, when sources are listed, then each entry carries path, title, status, content_pulled, published_at and excerpt |
| `BROWSE-02` | Given sources under two different domain folders, when listing is filtered by one prefix, then only that folder's sources are returned |
| `BROWSE-03` | Given a file whose frontmatter is damaged, when sources are listed, then it appears with an `error` field rather than being omitted from the results |
| `BROWSE-04` | Given a search term matching a title and another matching only an excerpt, when each is searched, then both match case-insensitively |
| `BROWSE-05` | Given sources with different `fetched_at` values, when listed, then they are ordered newest first |
| `BROWSE-06` | Given a path, when one source is loaded, then its raw text is returned byte-identical to what is stored |
| `BROWSE-07` | Given a request for a path outside the corpus, when it is loaded, then it is refused rather than served |
| `BROWSE-08` | Given a source with no `excerpt` in its frontmatter, when it is listed, then the excerpt falls back to the first real prose in its body, skipping navigation chrome |
| `BROWSE-10` | Given a source whose wrapper carries a `binary_key`, when it is listed, then the row reports the key and whether the bytes are present on this machine |
| `BROWSE-11` | Given a corpus with history, when `/api/changes` is called, then it returns the same records `corpora changes` renders, newest first, with truncation reported |
| `BROWSE-12` | Given a read-only server and an uncached binary, when it is fetched, then the bytes are returned, the cache is populated, and no store write or delete occurs |
| `BROWSE-13` | Given a request for a binary key outside `bin/`, when it is fetched, then it is refused rather than served |
| `BROWSE-14` | Given a corpus of many sources, when `/api/meta` is called, then it returns the count and domains without reading any file body |
| `BROWSE-15` | Given more sources than the page size and no search term, when a page is listed, then only that page's files are read from the store |
| `BROWSE-09` | Given both the `live/<type>/<slug>/sources/` layout and reach-edu's pre-existing `funders/<slug>/` and `strategies/<slug>/sources/`, when domains are derived, then each reads as an operator would name it |
| `BROWSE-16` | Given the same domain stored in both layouts — `<type>/<slug>/` and `live/<type>/<slug>/sources/` — when the listing is filtered by that domain, then sources from both are returned, because filtering is by folder rather than by raw key prefix |
| `BROWSE-17` | Given a slow search still in flight when a faster request is issued, when both resolve, then the newest request's result is the one shown and the stale one is dropped |
| `BROWSE-18` | Given a domain filter ending in `/` — the state the combobox's Backspace produces when it widens to a parent — when sources are listed, then every source under that parent is returned rather than none |

## Acceptance

```
uv run python scripts/spec_status.py --spec Browse-Corpus --require-green
```

exits 0, and the operator has opened the page against the real reach-edu corpus
and found something they recognise (Gate 4).

## Open questions

1. **Does this become the Tauri app's webview, or stay a separate web surface?**
   W5 wants both eventually. Deferred until there is a reason to choose.
2. **Plain HTML now, SvelteKit later?** The house style says Phase 7 inherits
   memopop-native's SvelteKit + Svelte 5. This screen is one self-contained page
   with no build step, deliberately, so it exists today. If it grows past a few
   hundred lines it should become the real thing rather than sprawl.
