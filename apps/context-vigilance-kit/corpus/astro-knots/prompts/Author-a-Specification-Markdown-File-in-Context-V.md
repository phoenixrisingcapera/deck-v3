lede: The verbatim prompt behind fullstack-vc's projects page spec — and the first
  time the team specced a page, not a flow or feature.
summary: 'Archived prompt kept as an example of how a page or component spec gets
  commissioned in this tree: it names the reminders directory to reboot on, points
  at a known-good spec to copy frontmatter and structure from, and states the output
  path and filename explicitly. Reuse its shape when asking an agent to author a new
  spec under `context-v/sitemap/pages/`.'

❯ I'd like to spec a page and the input components

  We likely need to spec new components here and put them into the design system.

  Traditionally, our team hasn't written a spec for pages or components, more like flows or
  features.

  So, I'd like you to get rebooted on our astro-knots pseudomonorepo
  /Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/astro-knots/context-v/reminders

  I'd like you to review our patterns for specs by looking at a good example to copy:
  /Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/astro-knots/context-v/specs/Codifying-a-Comprehensive-Exte
  nded-Markdown-Flavor-and-Shared-Package.md

  And I'd like you to create a spec for a Page called "projects/index.astro" including the
  `projects/[slug].astro`

  There will need to be a Hero with an image banner and a message hierarchy component. Then there
  will need to be a section `Section__ProjectGallery.asto` which we may want a few creative
  concepts on.

  The idea is to list active projects that have working groups in this peer learning community I'm
  calling fullstack-vc.  It should also have a way to display proposed projects and archived
  projects. Projects will be a content collection, we will need to include the project content
  model in the spec.

  Current active projects can be ported from the lossless group.  There is [Content
  Farm](https://www.lossless.group/projects/gallery/content-farm), [MemoPop
  AI](https://www.lossless.group/projects/gallery/memopop-ai), [Astro
  Knots](https://www.lossless.group/projects/gallery/astro-knots), [Augmented It](https://www.lossl
  ess.group/projects/gallery/augment-it/specs/data-augmentation-workflow-with-microfrontends)
  and [Context Vigilance](https://www.lossless.group/projects/gallery/context-vigilance)

  We also have a Jumbo Popover in the Header.  Sorry, a Jumbo Popdown that features projects. It's
  cool.  I have copied the Blueprint into the astro-knots/context-v folder.

  s.md

  Could you please uses this prompt to write a page spec in
  `/Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/astro-knots/sites/fullstack-vc/context-v/sitemap/pages`
  and name the file `Page__projects-index.astro`

  Please check to make sure you are setting up the frontmatter properly based on the example I
  listed above.`
