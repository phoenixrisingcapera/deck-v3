# Versatile Component Library for Video Players

**Status**: Draft (v0.1.0.0)
**Date**: 2026-05-07 · **Last updated**: 2026-08-18
**Author**: Michael Staton
**Parent spec**: [[Codifying-a-Comprehensive-Extended-Markdown-Flavor-and-Shared-Package]] — this document extracts and supersedes §4.12 (Zero-Friction Media Embeds) and the video-flavored portion of §4.23.6 (Inline Link Substitutions).

***

## Workflow Status

### Done
- [x] Bare-URL classifier (`remark-bare-link`) — paragraph-with-single-autolink detection
- [x] Provider catalog (`packages/lfm/src/plugins/Bare-Link-Provider-Catalog.md`) — frontmatter-as-record format
- [x] `YouTubeEmbed` — full video, 16:9
- [x] `YouTubeShortsEmbed` — dedicated 9:16, max-width 320, centered wrapper
- [x] `YouTubePlaylistEmbed` — wired but **needs visual polish and playlist-aware UX** (current focus)
- [x] `VimeoEmbed` — covers `/{id}`, `/{hash}`, `/channels/...`, `player.vimeo.com`
- [x] `LinkPreview__Video--FullPlayer` — name reserved for the bare-URL embed path; today the per-provider components fill this role
- [x] Curated playlist surfaces — `/playlists` and `/channels` on mpstaton-site, the first Tier E consumers (§4.5)
- [x] Per-item channel identity — fetcher records `videoOwnerChannel*` rather than the playlist owner (§4.1.3.8)
- [x] Build-artifact availability under `output: 'server'` — cache reaches the function bundle (§5.10)
- [x] Mobile sidebar scroll-container resolution — the panel's scroller is found after it opens (§5.9)

### In Progress
- [ ] Playlist component improvements — see §4.1.3 below
- [ ] `:::link-preview{type="video"}` directive routing through the same provider matchers

### Next
- [ ] `LinkPreview__Video--Row` — inline-with-prose density
- [ ] `LinkPreview__Video--Card` — aside-friendly density (carries `aside` attribute)
- [ ] `LinkPreview__Video--Thumb` — for use inside rollups
- [ ] `LinkPreview__Video--LiveSite` — sandboxed iframe of provider page (author opt-in)
- [ ] `LinkRollup__Column` × `type="video"` — children render as Video Row
- [ ] `LinkRollup__Gallery` × `type="video"` — children render as Video Card
- [ ] `LinkRollup__Carousel` × `type="video"` — children render as Video Card with prev/next
- [ ] `LinkRollup__ThumbRow--HorizontalScroll` × `type="video"` — children render as Video Thumb

### Wish List
- [ ] `LoomEmbed` — once the Loom matcher is added to the provider catalog
- [ ] Hover-to-preview inside `LinkPreview__Video--Card` (autoplay muted on hover, like YouTube's grid)
- [ ] Chapter-aware deep-linking (start time pulled from URL query params automatically)
- [ ] Provider-native captioning passthrough (when the provider exposes a captions URL)

## 1. Problem

The LFM spec already declares *that* video-flavored components exist and *how* the bare-link plugin dispatches to them, but it doesn't specify the component family in enough detail to drive implementation. The result:

- Authors paste a YouTube playlist URL and get an embed that works mechanically but doesn't communicate "this is a playlist, not a single video" — a UX gap the playlist case makes obvious.
- The `:::link-preview{type="video"}` directive is documented but no Video-flavored variants of `Row`, `Card`, `Thumb`, or `LiveSite` exist.
- The `LinkRollup__*` containers are documented but the contract for "what does a Video-typed child look like inside each container" is implicit.
- Cross-cutting concerns (theme tokens, aside compatibility, fence-equivalence, fallback behavior) are scattered across three sections of the parent spec.

Pulling video into its own spec lets the family grow without forcing every change to ride alongside unrelated LFM work.

## 2. Goal

A complete, implementable specification for the video-component family that:

1. **Lists every component** (built and planned) with its responsibility, inputs, sizing model, and accessibility contract.
2. **Defines the dispatch graph** — which markdown shapes route to which components, including the playlist-vs-video-vs-Short distinction the bare-link classifier already makes.
3. **Codifies the `LinkPreviewData` shape for video** — what every Video-flavored component is guaranteed to receive and how to fall back when fields are missing.
4. **Keeps the parent LFM spec focused** — once this lands, §4.12 and the video portion of §4.23.6 collapse to short summaries that point here.

## 3. The S→T→C Model: Syntax → Trigger → Component

Lossless Flavored Markdown is built on a three-stage pipeline: **Syntax → Trigger → Component**. Every renderable feature in LFM — whether it's a callout, a citation, a Mermaid diagram, an image directive, or a video player — must specify all three stages. A new component is not a feature until the syntax that triggers it and the trigger that maps to it are both codified.

This is the model the rest of this spec is organized around. Every video-flavored component in §4–§5 is paired with the syntax forms that route to it and the trigger logic that does the routing.

### 3.1 The Three Stages

**S — Syntax.** The shapes a markdown author can write that mean "render this as a video." LFM's polyglot principle (parent spec §3.4) means a single semantic intent typically has 2–3 syntactic surfaces — bare URL, directive, fenced-code-with-directive-lang — and the renderer treats them as equivalent.

**T — Trigger.** The parse-time logic that recognizes a Syntax shape and emits a normalized MDAST node. Triggers are remark plugins (`remark-bare-link`, `remark-directive`, `remark-code-fence-as-directive`) plus shared catalogs (`Bare-Link-Provider-Catalog.md`, the directive registry). A Trigger's job is to turn surface syntax into a stable internal representation — once the trigger has fired, downstream code only sees the internal node, never the original characters.

**C — Component.** The Astro/Svelte component the renderer dispatches the internal node to. Components consume the normalized props the trigger produced; they don't parse URLs, classify providers, or read the catalog. That separation is what lets one component (e.g. `YouTubeEmbed`) serve every Syntax form (bare URL, `::youtube-video{id}` directive, `youtube-video` code fence) without branching internally.

### 3.2 The Three Syntax Positions for Video

Every video URL an author writes lands in one of three positions. Each position routes through a different Trigger and ends at a different Component family:

| S — Syntax position | T — Trigger | C — Component family |
|---|---|---|
| Bare URL on its own line (paragraph with single autolink child) | `remark-bare-link` matches against the provider catalog; emits a `leafDirective` with `{ provider, id, kind, url }` | **Tier A** — per-provider embed components (`YouTubeEmbed`, `VimeoEmbed`, etc.) |
| `:::link-preview{type="video"}` containing one URL | `remark-directive` parses the container; the inline-link classifier (sharing the bare-link catalog) enriches the URL into `LinkPreviewData`; renderer dispatches on `name + format` | **`LinkPreview__Video--{Format}`** — substitution previews (Row / Card / Thumb / LiveSite / FullPlayer) |
| `:::link-rollup{type="video"}` containing 2+ URLs | `remark-directive` parses the container; the rollup wrapper classifies each child URL via the same catalog; renders the container component with each child as a `LinkPreview__Video--{ChildFormat}` | **`LinkRollup__{Format}`** with Video-flavored children |

A fourth Syntax position — the **directive form on its own** (`::youtube-video{id="..."}`) — is the explicit equivalent of bare-URL Tier-A. It exists for authors who need control over embed attributes (start time, autoplay, mute) that bare URLs can't carry. Same Trigger output, same Component — just a different Syntax surface.

### 3.3 Why All Three Forms Share One Catalog

The Trigger stage for all three positions reads from a single source of truth: `packages/lfm/src/plugins/Bare-Link-Provider-Catalog.md`. This is what guarantees that:

- A bare YouTube URL, an `::youtube-video` directive, and a `:::link-preview{type="video"}` wrapping a YouTube URL all classify to the same `provider: 'youtube'`, same ID extraction, same fallback behavior.
- Adding a new provider (say, Loom) takes one frontmatter entry in the catalog — every Syntax position picks it up automatically.
- Components never duplicate URL parsing. The classification has happened by the time a component receives its props.

### 3.4 Worked Example: YouTube Playlist URL

Walk a single playlist URL through S→T→C end to end:

**S — Syntax (what the author writes):**
```markdown
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1&si=SKKEtkemYJ5tpQRO
```
A bare URL on its own line — the simplest Syntax position.

**T — Trigger (what the parser does):**
1. `remark-gfm` autolinks the URL — the paragraph now contains a single `link` node whose `value` equals its `url`.
2. `remark-bare-link` walks paragraphs, recognizes the bare-URL signal, and tries each provider's matchers from `Bare-Link-Provider-Catalog.md` in order.
3. The `youtube-playlist` matcher hits: `host: youtube.com`, `path: /playlist`, `query.list: ^(?<id>[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)$`. `id` captures as `PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1`. The `si` tracking param is discarded.
4. The plugin replaces the paragraph with a `leafDirective` node: `{ name: 'youtube-playlist', attributes: { id: 'PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1', provider: 'youtube', kind: 'playlist' } }`.

**C — Component (what the renderer mounts):**
1. `AstroMarkdown.astro` walks the MDAST, hits the `leafDirective` whose name is `youtube-playlist`, and dispatches to `YouTubePlaylistEmbed.astro`.
2. The component receives `id` (and any other attributes the directive form would have supplied — `index`, `start`, etc.); it does **not** parse the URL or know what `youtube.com/playlist?list=…` looks like.
3. The component renders the playlist iframe with the visual differentiation specified in §4.1.3.

The same `YouTubePlaylistEmbed` component would have been mounted if the author had instead written:

```markdown
::youtube-playlist{id="PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1" index=2}
```

…or the Obsidian-portable fence form:

````markdown
```youtube-playlist id="PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1" index=2
```
````

Three Syntax surfaces, one Trigger output, one Component. That's the S→T→C contract.

### 3.5 Acceptance Criterion for New Features

When this spec adds a new component or a new provider, the work is **not done** until all three columns are filled in:

1. **S — Syntax.** Document every shape the author may write. At minimum: bare URL pattern (if applicable), directive form (`::name{attrs}` or `:::name{attrs}`), code-fence-equivalent (Obsidian portability).
2. **T — Trigger.** Either add a frontmatter entry to `Bare-Link-Provider-Catalog.md` (for bare-URL auto-unfurl), register the directive in the directive registry (for directive forms), or both. Specify the matcher regex, the named captures, the discarded query params, and the emitted node shape.
3. **C — Component.** Specify the props the component receives (named after the trigger's normalized output), the rendering contract, and the fallback behavior.

A pull request adding only Component code without specifying Syntax and Trigger is incomplete and should be rejected. A pull request adding Syntax + Trigger without a Component renders to a no-op and ships a build warning.

***

## 4. The Component Family

The three rendering positions defined in §3.2 each map to a Component family. This section specifies the components themselves.

### 4.1 Tier A — Bare-URL Auto-Unfurl Players (Per-Provider)

A bare URL on its own line auto-unfurls to a full embedded player. The bare-link plugin's matchers determine which component takes over.

#### 4.1.1 Dispatch Map (current and planned)

| Status | Provider / kind | URL shapes | Directive emitted | Component |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ Stable | YouTube — full video | `youtu.be/{id}`, `youtube.com/watch?v={id}` | `::youtube-video` | `YouTubeEmbed` |
| ✅ Stable | YouTube — Short | `youtube.com/shorts/{id}` | `::youtube-short` | `YouTubeShortsEmbed` |
| ✅ Stable | YouTube — Playlist | `youtube.com/playlist?list={id}` | `::youtube-playlist` | `YouTubePlaylistEmbed` |
| ✅ Stable | Vimeo | `vimeo.com/{id}` (incl. `/{hash}`, `/channels/...`), `player.vimeo.com/video/{id}` | `::vimeo` | `VimeoEmbed` |
| 🟡 Planned | Loom | `loom.com/share/{id}` | `::loom` | `LoomEmbed` |

The frontmatter of `Bare-Link-Provider-Catalog.md` is the source of truth — the table above is a summary. New providers land by adding a frontmatter entry first; the parser picks them up automatically.

#### 4.1.2 Per-Component Contracts

Each Tier-A component MUST:

1. **Render a 16:9 (or 9:16 for Shorts) responsive frame** that scales with the column it's placed in, never overflows horizontally on mobile, and never causes CLS at load.
2. **Expose a single `id` prop** (the provider-specific video/playlist/etc. ID extracted by the matcher) plus optional `start`, `autoplay`, `mute`, `loop`, `controls` props that the directive form (Tier B, §4.2) can supply.
3. **Use lazy-loading by default** (`loading="lazy"` on the iframe, or a click-to-play poster for heavy embeds — see §5.4 for the "facade" pattern).
4. **Read theme tokens, not hex literals** — see §5.3.
5. **Degrade to a labeled link** if the embed fails to mount (network blocked, embed disallowed by provider).

##### `YouTubeEmbed`
- Full 16:9 player. Uses `youtube-nocookie.com` privacy-enhanced embed by default.
- Inputs: `id` (11-char), `start?` (seconds), `autoplay?`, `mute?`.
- Accessibility: `<iframe title="YouTube video {id}">` plus a visible caption slot when the directive form supplies `title`.

##### `YouTubeShortsEmbed`
- 9:16 vertical frame, `max-width: 320px`, centered.
- Distinct from `YouTubeEmbed` because Shorts have a different aspect, different default UX expectation (mobile-first), and a different recommended iframe sizing strategy.
- Same input set, minus `start` (Shorts are too short for time deep-links to matter).

##### `YouTubePlaylistEmbed` *(current focus — see §4.1.3)*
- 16:9 player paired with **our own** sidebar (theme-token-chromed, server-rendered from build-time data) — not YouTube's iframe sidebar. The author-facing surface is one component; under the hood it's an Astro shell + a small Svelte island for click-to-play interactivity.
- Inputs: `id` (the playlist ID, prefixed `PL`/`UU`/`OL` etc.), `index?` (which item to start on, default 0), `start?` (seconds within the starting item).
- **Distinguishes itself visually** from a single-video embed via header strip (title + item count + channel) and item sidebar — see §4.1.3 for the full architecture.

##### `VimeoEmbed`
- 16:9 frame, Vimeo's player chrome.
- Inputs: `id` (numeric), `hash?` (private/unlisted), `start?` (seconds), `autoplay?`, `mute?`, `loop?`.
- Channel/staff-picks/showcase URLs all reduce to a single Vimeo numeric ID by the matcher; the component never knows about the marketing URL.

##### `LoomEmbed` *(planned)*
- Per Loom's embed URL pattern (`loom.com/embed/{id}`).
- Inputs: `id`, `start?`, `t?`. Loom's iframe has the most stable embed contract of the planned providers.

#### 4.1.3 Playlist UX — Full Architecture

A playlist URL today auto-unfurls to a frame that looks identical to a single-video embed — same chrome, same aspect, same affordances. The fix is to **own the sidebar**: server-render our own list of playlist items at build time, hide YouTube's built-in sidebar, and use a small client-side island to wire click-to-play through the YouTube IFrame Player API.

This decision favors *control* over *zero-API-key minimum*. The cost is a YouTube Data API v3 key in `.env`; the payoff is a playlist component that visually communicates "this is a bundle of N videos" before the user clicks play, themes cleanly, and never makes a runtime API call (everything is build-time and cached).

##### 4.1.3.1 Data acquisition (build-time)

A `youtube-playlist-fetcher` runs during the build, parallel to the existing OG fetcher. For each unique playlist ID encountered in the markdown corpus:

1. **Playlist metadata** — `GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlists?id={id}&part=snippet,contentDetails&key={YOUTUBE_API_KEY}`. Returns title, description, channel, item count.
2. **Playlist items** — `GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?playlistId={id}&part=snippet,contentDetails&maxResults=50&pageToken={...}&key={...}`. Returns each item's `videoId`, position, title, thumbnails, channel. Paginated when item count > 50.
3. **Video durations** — `GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?id={comma-separated-ids}&part=contentDetails&key={...}`. Batched in groups of 50 video IDs per request. Required because `playlistItems` does not include duration.

The three calls combine into a single cache entry per playlist:

```ts
interface PlaylistCacheEntry {
  id: string;                       // playlist ID
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  channelTitle: string;
  channelId: string;
  itemCount: number;                 // contentDetails.itemCount
  thumbnail: string;                 // playlist thumbnail (highest available)
  fetchedAt: string;                 // ISO timestamp
  items: PlaylistItem[];
}

interface PlaylistItem {
  videoId: string;
  position: number;                  // zero-indexed, matches IFrame API playVideoAt
  title: string;
  thumbnail: string;                 // medium or high res
  duration?: string;                 // ISO 8601 (PT4M30S); absent if video is unavailable
  addedAt?: string;                  // ISO timestamp; sourced from snippet.publishedAt;
                                     // primary sort key for the default "most-recently-added on top" view
  channelTitle?: string;
  unavailable?: boolean;             // private / deleted videos that show as "Private video"
}
```

**Default sort.** Items are stored by playlist `position` in the cache (the playlist owner's defined order). The render layer sorts by `addedAt` descending before passing items to the scroller, so the most-recently-added video is on top regardless of the playlist owner's curation order. Click handler still uses each item's actual `position` for the iframe's `playVideoAt(N)` call, so the visual order of the scroller is decoupled from playback addressing.

##### 4.1.3.2 Cache and quotas

Cache file: `src/data/youtube-playlist-cache.json` (gitignored, like the OG cache). Keyed by playlist ID. TTL configurable per-site (default 30 days — playlists change rarely; titles change rarer).

Quota: each playlist costs ~3 API calls (1 playlist + 1 playlistItems for ≤50 items + 1 videos for durations). The free tier (10,000 units/day) covers hundreds of unique playlists per build. A site with >100 unique playlists per build should consider extending the TTL or upgrading the quota.

Failure modes:
- **API key missing** — fetcher logs a warning, writes a minimal cache entry with just `id` and `itemCount: 0`, the component degrades to facade mode (poster + "Open on YouTube" CTA).
- **Rate limited (429)** — same fallback; the playlist with no fresh data gets last-known-good from the existing cache, or facade mode if no prior cache entry exists.
- **Playlist private/deleted** — fetcher records `unavailable: true` and the component shows a deactivated card.

##### 4.1.3.3 Render layout — two sibling elements, not one card

The component renders **two visually-separate sibling elements**, not a single combined card:

1. **The player card** (`.yt-playlist-card`) — header strip + 16:9 iframe. Stays in the article reading column at the column's full width. Treated as a normal embed in the prose flow.
2. **The playlist scroller** (`.yt-playlist-scroller`) — the sortable, scrollable list of items. **Escape-positioned in the right margin track** at ≥1280px viewport. Below 1280px, stacks below the card (capped to ~3 items visible). Below 768px, becomes a `MobileFeaturePlaceholder` placeholder + full-screen panel.

The two are siblings inside a `position: relative` wrapper. The card flows normally; the scroller uses absolute positioning to escape into the right margin track. **The scroller can be taller than the card** — its natural height runs down past the card's bottom edge, parallel to the prose that follows the playlist URL. Prose in the article column never overlaps the scroller because the scroller's left edge starts past the article column's right edge.

```

```

**Why two siblings, not one card:**

- Reading flow stays intact. The player is treated as a normal in-column embed, like any other iframe a memo might paste; readers don't have to retrain their eye on a wider content surface.
- The scroller can be tall without forcing the player to also be tall, and without leaving a giant empty space below the player.
- The two elements decouple visually — the scroller reads as supplementary nav (a sticky-note in the margin), not as a sub-region of the player's frame.
- The pattern generalizes. Any future component that wants the same "primary in column, supplementary in margin" structure can ship its own card + scroller pair using the same wrapper conventions.

**Breakpoints:**

| Viewport | Player card | Scroller |
|---|---|---|
| ≥1280px | In article column at full column width | Escape-positioned in right margin via `position: absolute` |
| 768–1279px | In article column at full column width | Stacks below the card; `max-height: 232px` (~3 items + scroll) |
| ≤768px | In article column | `MobileFeaturePlaceholder` — placeholder card + full-screen panel on tap |

**Active-item highlight** in the scroller updates as the iframe's `getPlaylistIndex()` changes, regardless of which mode the scroller is in.

##### 4.1.3.4 The two-component DOM and Svelte island

DOM shape rendered by `YouTubePlaylistEmbed.astro` (or whichever orchestrator file the consuming site uses):

```astro
<div class="yt-playlist-block">
  <!-- 1. Player card — flows in article column -->
  <aside class="yt-playlist-card">
    <header class="yt-playlist-card__header">
      <!-- title, channel, count, "Open on YouTube" CTA -->
    </header>
    <div class="yt-playlist-card__player">
      <iframe id={iframeId} src="...enablejsapi=1..." />
    </div>
  </aside>

  <!-- 2. Scroller — escape-positioned in margin (≥1280px) or stacked below (<1280px) -->
  <aside class="yt-playlist-scroller">
    <MobileFeaturePlaceholder ...>
      <Fragment slot="placeholder">...</Fragment>
      <PlaylistSidebar client:visible items={...} iframeId={iframeId} />
    </MobileFeaturePlaceholder>
  </aside>
</div>
```

The card and the scroller are **independent DOM siblings**. They communicate only via the `iframeId` prop the orchestrator passes to both: the scroller's Svelte island finds the iframe by ID and uses `postMessage` to send `playVideoAt(N)` commands. No shared state, no parent component holding both, no event-bus pattern. The Svelte island is the thinnest possible interactive layer.

A consuming site that wants to extract the player card and the scroller as separate components later can do so with no behavior change — the contract (one shared `iframeId` string, the YouTube IFrame Player API for messaging) doesn't depend on file boundaries.

##### 4.1.3.5 The `aside-escape` CSS recipe (cross-cutting)

The escape behavior on the scroller is the first concrete consumer of the **right-escape** pattern named in §5.5 of the parent spec. The CSS recipe at ≥1280px:

```css
.yt-playlist-block {
  position: relative;
}

.yt-playlist-card {
  /* normal flow; full article column width */
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .yt-playlist-scroller {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;                                                            /* aligned with card top */
    left: calc(100% + 1.5rem);                                         /* gap past column edge */
    width: min(340px, calc(((100vw - 100%) / 2) - 2rem));              /* fits available margin */
    max-height: min(80vh, 720px);                                      /* practical cap */
    /* Inner list scrolls within this height */
  }
}
```

**Why this works:**
- `100%` resolves to the wrapper (`.yt-playlist-block`)'s width, which matches the article column's content width.
- `(100vw - 100%) / 2` is the unused margin space outside the centered article column.
- The scroller's left edge starts 1.5rem past the column's right edge; its width fills the remaining margin, capped at 340px, with 2rem of viewport-edge padding.
- Because the scroller is `position: absolute`, it's taken out of flow — the wrapper's height equals only the card's height, and prose after the playlist URL flows from the card's bottom normally. The scroller hangs down into the margin track in parallel with that prose.

**Below 1280px:**
```css
.yt-playlist-scroller {
  margin-top: 0.5rem;
  max-height: 232px;       /* ~3 items + scroll affordance */
  overflow: hidden;
  /* Inner list scrolls within max-height */
}
```

**Generalizing:** any future component that wants the same structure (in-column primary + escape-positioned aside) can declare its own `.foo-block` wrapper with `position: relative`, render the primary content as a normal-flow child, and apply the same `position: absolute; left: calc(100% + gap); width: min(maxw, ...)` recipe to its aside child. When a second consumer needs this, the CSS becomes a `MarginEscape.astro` wrapper component (not yet extracted; deferred per "premature extraction is worse than waiting one round").

Why Svelte and not vanilla JS: this is the smallest interactive unit on the site that's worth a framework — the postMessage/event-listener wiring + the active-item state syncing is tedious in vanilla, three lines in Svelte. Astro's `client:visible` directive defers hydration until the playlist scrolls into view, so playlists below the fold don't pay the JS cost until needed.

##### 4.1.3.6 Authoring contract (unchanged)

The author writes either a bare URL or the directive form. Both paths produce the same component with the same props:

```markdown
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1

:::youtube-playlist{align="left"}
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1
:::

::youtube-playlist{id="PLME9DvdybGUN7PtbmJhSyYcUakt7tAya1" index=2}
```

The `align` attribute on directive form mirrors the Shorts pattern (§4.1.2 — float right by default, `align="left"` to flip). Default for playlists is full-column though, since at typical reading widths the sidebar won't fit at float widths. `align` becomes meaningful only at viewports wide enough to host both the player and surrounding prose.

##### 4.1.3.7 Open implementation questions

1. **Active-item highlight on first paint.** The Svelte island can't know the current video before hydration; the SSR'd sidebar shows item 0 (or the `index` prop value) as active. If the user has been watching a few items before scrolling back, the highlight will lag until hydration catches up. Acceptable for v1.
2. **Playlist with >200 items.** Fetcher pages through all of them but the sidebar gets unwieldy. Decision: cap displayed items at 50, show a "Show all on YouTube" link below the sidebar when the playlist exceeds the cap. Cache still stores all items for completeness.
3. **Private/deleted items** show as inactive sidebar entries with a struck-through title and no click handler. Not skipped — the position numbering matters for parity with YouTube's own list.
4. **Sidebar at narrow widths.** Use the cross-cutting mobile-sidebar pattern (§5.9): in-article a compact "feature placeholder" card shows a thumbnail strip + title + count + a "Browse playlist →" CTA. Tapping the CTA (or swiping left) slides the sidebar in as a full-screen panel; swipe right (or tap a back button) returns the reader to the article. The iframe player remains in the article view; the full-screen sidebar is browse-only. This pattern applies to *every* sidebar-positioned component in LFM, not just playlists — playlist is the first consumer.

##### 4.1.3.8 Per-item channel identity

Each cached item records the channel the **video lives on**, from `playlistItems`' `videoOwnerChannelTitle` and `videoOwnerChannelId`.

This is not the obvious field and the obvious field is wrong. `snippet.channelTitle` / `snippet.channelId` on the same response identify the account that **added the item to the playlist** — on an owner-curated playlist that is the owner on every row, which the playlist-level entry already records. Reading it per-item produces a library where every video appears to belong to one channel. Implementations must read the `videoOwner*` pair.

Both fields are absent on private and deleted videos, so both are optional and consumers treat a missing channel as "no channel", not as an empty one.

**Store the id, not just the title.** A display name cannot survive a rename and cannot separate two channels that share one — a condition already present in the reference library, which holds 2,196 channels by id against 2,195 by title. Anything that groups, counts, or links by channel keys on `videoOwnerChannelId` and treats the title as a label.

No quota cost: the fields ride along on `playlistItems` pages the fetcher already pages through.

***

### 4.2 Tier B — Directive-Form Players

Authors who need to control embed behavior (start time, autoplay, dimensions) write the directive form. Tier-B and Tier-A **share the same component** per provider — Tier-A is just sugar that produces the same `leafDirective` node Tier-B writes by hand.

```markdown
::youtube-video{id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" start="42" autoplay}

::youtube-playlist{id="PLrAXtmRdnEQy6nuLMfO6gpRH7Wey7zkB7" index=2 mute}

::vimeo{id="76979871" hash="abc123def4" start=30}
```

The renderer's dispatch is `leafDirective.name` → component lookup. Adding a provider extends one map; nothing else changes.

### 4.3 Tier C — Inline-Substitution Previews (`LinkPreview__Video--{Format}`)

When the author writes `:::link-preview{type="video"}` around a URL, the URL is **replaced in the document flow** by a card-sized component. This is for "see this video" moments where a full embed would be heavy and an autolink would be too quiet.

#### 4.3.1 Format Matrix

| Format | Visual density | Best for | Min required data |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Row` | Low (~64-80px tall, one line) | Inline in prose without breaking flow | title, source domain, thumbnail |
| `Card` | Medium (~240-320px tall) | Asides, feature blocks, sidebars | title, description, thumbnail, duration |
| `Thumb` | High (small image + title only) | Inside rollups and dense grids | title, thumbnail |
| `LiveSite` | Variable (sandboxed iframe of the provider page) | Author-trusted demos | URL only |
| `FullPlayer` | Full-bleed embedded media | Bare-URL auto-unfurl path (§4.1) | provider, id |

`Row`, `Card`, `Thumb` differ in *density*, not *data shape* — they all consume the same `LinkPreviewData` (§5.2). A site that builds `Card` first can ship `Row` and `Thumb` as CSS variants of the same component if it wants; the spec does not require three separate files.

#### 4.3.2 Acceptance Criteria

Every `LinkPreview__Video--{Format}` component MUST:

1. **Pull thumbnail from the provider** before falling back to OG (`img.youtube.com/vi/{id}/maxresdefault.jpg` for YouTube; Vimeo's oEmbed `thumbnail_url`). The provider matchers in the bare-link catalog already give us the ID — components reuse that work, they don't refetch.
2. **Show duration** when the provider exposes it via oEmbed and the format slot calls for it (Card has it; Row does not).
3. **Click-to-play** semantics: clicking the card replaces it with the corresponding Tier-A embed (or opens the provider page in a new tab if the site has chosen the "no-embed" policy via theme config).
4. **Render an `aside`-compatible wrapper** when the directive carries `aside=`. See §5.5 for the compatibility matrix.
5. **Degrade to a plain autolink** if both provider matchers fail and the OG fetch fails. Never render an empty card.

### 4.4 Tier D — Multi-URL Containers (`LinkRollup__*` with Video Children)

A `:::link-rollup{type="video"}` container holds 2+ URLs and applies one layout to all of them. The container declares the layout; each child is rendered as the matching density variant.

#### 4.4.1 Container × Child Rendering Map

| Container format | Layout | Children render as |
|---|---|---|
| `Column` | Vertical stacked list | `LinkPreview__Video--Row` |
| `Gallery` | Grid (configurable `columns`, default 3) | `LinkPreview__Video--Card` |
| `Carousel` | Horizontal scroll with prev/next + pagination dots | `LinkPreview__Video--Card` |
| `ThumbRow--HorizontalScroll` | Horizontal scroll of compact thumbnails | `LinkPreview__Video--Thumb` |

The container itself is **type-agnostic** — `LinkRollup__Gallery` works for `type="article"`, `type="video"`, etc. The container reads `type` from its directive attributes and dispatches each child to the correct `LinkPreview__{Type}--{ChildFormat}` component. Mixed-type rollups require multiple containers.

#### 4.4.2 Container Acceptance Criteria

1. **Lazy-render children below the fold** — particularly important for `Gallery` with many video items (each child is fetching a thumbnail).
2. **Honor the `columns` attribute** for Gallery (1–6, default 3, narrows to 1 on mobile via container query).
3. **Honor the `aside` attribute** with the same compatibility matrix as single previews (Column + aside = vertical list in margin track; Gallery + escape-aside = collapse to 1 column).
4. **Handle URL parsing failures gracefully** — a single broken child renders as an autolink without breaking the container layout.

***

### 4.5 Tier E — Curated Surfaces (no markdown trigger)

Tiers A–D all begin with something an author wrote in a document. Tier E does not: these are destination pages assembled from the same cache, for a library that exists whether or not any document mentions it. `/playlists` and `/channels` on mpstaton-site are the reference implementations.

**A registry, because content-scraping cannot see a page.** `discoverPlaylistIds()` walks `src/content/` for playlist URLs, which is exactly right for a playlist an author pasted into prose and useless for a curated page under `src/pages/`. A site with curated surfaces declares them in `src/config/playlists.ts` — an ordered, labelled, explicit set the fetcher seeds from *before* it scans content. Without it a curated playlist renders in facade mode forever, because no markdown file mentions it.

**Counts come from the cache, never from the registry.** The registry carries labels and order; it must not carry a video count. A hand-written number is a claim the page cannot verify and YouTube will eventually disagree with.

**Runtime count refresh.** Under `output: 'server'` the build-time count is correct at deploy and drifts from then on. Sites may layer a stale-while-revalidate read on top: `playlists.list` takes comma-separated ids and costs one quota unit for the whole set however many videos they contain. Rules — the read never awaits the network, a stale value returns immediately while a refresh runs in the background, and an empty response leaves the previous value in place rather than zeroing the page. A slow or failing API delays the *next* correct number; it can never delay or break a render.

> A deliberate non-goal: a cron job. A scheduled function on a read-only, discarded filesystem has nowhere to write the refreshed number, so cron means adding a KV or Blob store — real infrastructure for one integer. Refreshing in the request path gets the same "checks daily, never rebuilds" outcome with no new services.

**Derived surfaces (`/channels`).** A channel view is a roll-up of cached items keyed by `videoOwnerChannelId` (§4.1.3.8), ranked by how many of that channel's videos the library keeps. It is **derived at build time, never hand-listed** — a written-down top-N is wrong the moment a playlist grows, and is a second claim about the library that can contradict the first. Deriving from the cache both surfaces read makes contradiction impossible.

**Editorial overlay.** Volume is a proxy for "favourite", not the thing itself; it cannot say *this one is excellent, I have kept three*. Judgement lives in a small committed file keyed by channel id, holding only the channels with something to say about them — never a copy of the derived data. Three properties matter:

1. **Seeded, not hand-authored.** A script writes every channel above the threshold at `favorite: false`. The judgement is the human's; looking up a hundred `UC...` ids is not.
2. **Additive on re-run.** Existing flags and notes survive; new channels arrive unpicked.
3. **Never destructive.** A channel that falls below the threshold stays in the file. Deleting curation because a playlist shifted is the one move here that cannot be undone.

**Ranking spans every channel, not the displayed ones.** A pick below the display cutoff must still surface — expressing something the counts do not is the entire reason the overlay exists.

***

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5.1 Provider Catalog (Single Source of Truth)

`packages/lfm/src/plugins/Bare-Link-Provider-Catalog.md` carries every provider entry as YAML in its frontmatter. Every component in this spec reads its provider classification from there — no hardcoded URL parsing inside components. Adding a video provider takes three edits:

1. Add a frontmatter entry (id, kind, directive, component, matchers).
2. Add the component file matching `component:`.
3. Add a row to the dispatch table in §4.1.1 of this spec.

The catalog's frontmatter format is documented in the catalog itself.

### 5.2 The `LinkPreviewData` Shape (Video Specialization)

Every `LinkPreview__Video--*` and the `LinkRollup__*` children consume the same `LinkPreviewData` interface defined in §4.23.6 of the parent LFM spec. The Video-relevant fields:

```ts
interface LinkPreviewData {
  type: 'video';
  url: string;                       // canonical URL the author wrote
  provider: string;                  // 'youtube' | 'vimeo' | 'loom' | ...
  providerId: string;                // YouTube video ID, Vimeo numeric ID, etc.
  providerKind?: string;             // 'video' | 'short' | 'playlist'
  providerExtra?: Record<string, string>; // e.g. { hash: 'abc123' } for unlisted Vimeo

  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  image?: string;                    // thumbnail URL — provider-direct preferred, OG fallback
  imageAlt?: string;
  duration?: string;                 // ISO 8601 (PT4M30S) when available

  source?: string;                   // human label — 'YouTube', 'Vimeo'
  sourceFavicon?: string;
}
```

A component renders against whatever subset is present and degrades gracefully when fields are missing. Components MUST NOT throw on missing `description` or `duration`.

### 5.3 Theme-Token Neutrality

Every component in this family reads semantic tokens (`--card`, `--card-foreground`, `--border`, `--muted-foreground`, `--brand-aqua`, etc.) — never hex literals. Same convention as `MermaidChartDisplay.astro`. This is what lets a single component file work across every site without per-site forks.

Sites that opt into the `LinkPreview__Video--*` family must declare the relevant tokens in their `theme.css`. The parent spec's theme-token blueprint (`Maintain-Themes-Mode-Across-CSS-Tailwind.md`) governs the contract.

### 5.4 Lazy-Load and Facade Strategy

Heavy embeds (full YouTube/Vimeo iframes) bloat first-paint. Each Tier-A component MUST support a "facade" mode where the initial render is a thumbnail + play-button overlay; the iframe mounts on click. Sites opt in via theme config:

```ts
// site config
lfm: {
  videoEmbeds: {
    facadeByDefault: true,   // render facade until clicked
    autoplayOnFacadeClick: true,
  }
}
```

Facade-by-default is **strongly recommended** for content-heavy pages (memos with multiple embeds). Direct-embed mode remains available for pages where instant playback matters (a single hero video at the top of a page).

### 5.5 Aside Compatibility (Margin Tracks)

Inherited from the parent spec's §4.23.6. Video-flavored applicability:

| Component | `aside=none` | `left` / `right` | `left-escape` / `right-escape` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier-A embeds (`YouTubeEmbed` etc.) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `LinkPreview__Video--Row` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `LinkPreview__Video--Card` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `LinkPreview__Video--Thumb` | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ (collapses to float) |
| `LinkPreview__Video--LiveSite` | ✅ | ⚠️ (discouraged) | ⚠️ |
| `LinkRollup__Column` × video | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `LinkRollup__Gallery` × video | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ (collapses to 1 column) |
| `LinkRollup__Carousel` × video | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| `LinkRollup__ThumbRow--HorizontalScroll` × video | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

✅ = supported. ⚠️ = allowed but degrades. ❌ = not supported (renders inline with a build warning).

### 5.6 Obsidian-Portable Fence-Equivalence

Authors editing in Obsidian frequently use code-fence-with-custom-lang shapes for community plugins. LFM's `remark-code-fence-as-directive` (forthcoming) treats a fence whose lang matches a registered LFM directive name as semantically equivalent to the `:::` form. Every video directive in this spec MUST be reachable both ways:

````markdown
::youtube-video{id="dQw4w9WgXcQ"}
````

````markdown
```youtube-video id="dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```
````

````markdown
:::link-preview{type="video" format="card"}
https://youtu.be/jCe2wg1ulus
:::
````

````markdown
```link-preview type="video" format="card"
https://youtu.be/jCe2wg1ulus
```
````

The renderer doesn't care which form the author wrote — both produce the same MDAST node, both dispatch to the same component.

### 5.7 Auto-Unfurl Opt-Out

Prefix a bare URL with `\` to suppress auto-unfurl and render it as a plain autolink:

```markdown
\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

Useful for "I'm referencing this URL, I don't want a player" situations.

### 5.8 Privacy Posture

YouTube embeds use `youtube-nocookie.com` by default. Vimeo's player is GDPR-friendly out of the box. Sites that need stricter posture (e.g. publishing in EU jurisdictions with an active cookie banner) opt into facade-only mode (§5.4) so no provider iframe loads until the reader explicitly clicks play.

### 5.9 Mobile Sidebar Pattern (cross-cutting)

Any LFM component that renders a *sidebar* alongside primary content on desktop — the playlist sidebar (§4.1.3.3), the upcoming `LinkRollup__Column` aside variant, the `LinkPreview__*--Card` with `aside="right"`, or any future sidebar-shaped surface — needs a coherent mobile fallback. The reading column on a phone is too narrow to host a sidebar inline; collapsing the sidebar to a stacked block below the primary content buries it.

**The pattern (`MobileFeaturePlaceholder`):**

On mobile (≤768px viewport), the sidebar is replaced inline by a **feature-placeholder card** — a compact, scannable preview of what's in the sidebar plus a clear CTA to browse the full thing. Tapping the CTA (or a leftward swipe gesture on the placeholder) slides the full sidebar in as a **full-screen panel** that occupies the viewport. The reader navigates the sidebar in that dedicated screen; a back button or a rightward swipe returns them to the article view at the same scroll position.

| Surface | Desktop (≥1024px) | Tablet (768–1023px) | Mobile (≤768px) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary content (player / article body) | Visible alongside sidebar | Visible alongside sidebar (narrower) | Visible; sidebar replaced by placeholder card |
| Sidebar | Right column, sticky-friendly | Right column, narrower | **Full-screen panel** on demand |
| Reader navigation between the two | Always-visible side-by-side | Always-visible side-by-side | Tap CTA / swipe → swipe back |

**Why this pattern, not "stack below" or "horizontal-scroll thumb row":**

- *Stack below* loses the affordance — the sidebar's "I'm related but secondary" semantics get flattened into "more body content."
- *Horizontal-scroll thumb row* works only when the sidebar's items are visually compact (thumbnails) and uniform (no per-item metadata that wants vertical space). A playlist item with title + duration + channel doesn't fit.
- *Full-screen panel* preserves the spatial relationship readers learn from desktop ("this thing is *over there*, accessible when I want it") and gives the sidebar enough room to render its native density without compromise.

**Component contract:**

A new shared component `MobileFeaturePlaceholder.astro` (lives in `src/components/markdown/` per consuming site, or eventually in a shared `@knots/*` patterns package) accepts:
- A *placeholder render* (Astro slot) — the compact preview visible inline on mobile
- A *full-content render* (Astro slot) — the same content the desktop sidebar shows, displayed in the full-screen panel
- A `label` prop ("Browse playlist", "See related", etc.) — the CTA text

The component handles the panel slide-in/-out, swipe gestures (touch events with a horizontal-velocity threshold), focus management (panel traps focus when open, returns it on close), scroll restoration, and the back-button affordance (both an in-panel button and the browser back button via `history.pushState` so swipe-back isn't the only escape).

The desktop sidebar render is wrapped in a `<MobileFeaturePlaceholder>` boundary by every consuming component. CSS `@media` rules and the placeholder's internal logic decide which surface (inline placeholder vs. always-visible sidebar vs. full-screen panel) is active at the current viewport.

**Implementation track:** Phase 1a builds this for the playlist as the first consumer, then any future sidebar-positioned component reuses the same `MobileFeaturePlaceholder` boundary. The pattern is documented here, not deferred to per-component implementation, so subsequent components inherit the contract instead of inventing their own.

**The scroll container must be re-resolved, not cached at mount.** Any control inside the panel that scrolls it — "up N", "down N", scroll-to-active — has to locate the scrolling element at the moment it acts, or when the panel's open state changes. Resolving once on mount is wrong on mobile and fails silently: at mount the panel is `display: none` and the panel body has no `overflow-y`, so a walk up the ancestor chain finds nothing scrollable and settles on the inline desktop container instead. The controls then drive an element the reader cannot see, and any state derived from a scroll listener on it — "am I at the top", which gates a disabled attribute — never updates either. Consumers watch the open-state attribute on the placeholder wrapper and re-resolve when it flips.

**Panel controls are not exempt from the scroll-position trap.** Sticky bars *look* pinned but their layout position is wherever they sit in the flow — for a bottom bar, after every item. Anything that scrolls an element into view by reference (including a test harness clicking a button) will drag the container to that layout position. When verifying these controls, drive them at real screen coordinates or programmatically, and be aware that a dev-toolbar overlay anchored to the same edge will absorb coordinate taps aimed at them.

***

### 5.10 Build-time artifacts under `output: 'server'` (cross-cutting)

**A build-time cache read from disk at request time is not there.** This applies to every artifact in this spec's data path — the playlist cache, the OG cache, any gitignored JSON a component reads — on any site running server output on a serverless host.

Two independent failures, both silent:

1. The artifact is gitignored, so nothing traces it into the function bundle. The compiled chunk ships; the data does not.
2. `import.meta.url` inside a bundled chunk resolves to the build output directory, not to source. A path relative to the module misses even where the file was copied.

Neither raises. `existsSync` returns `false`, the loader returns `{}`, every lookup returns `null`, and the component renders its facade — on a deploy whose fetcher logged complete success. **The build log is not evidence that the data reached the renderer.**

Load such artifacts through a bundler-visible import so the data is inlined into the chunk:

```ts
const modules = import.meta.glob<{ default: Cache }>('../data/cache.json', { eager: true });
const cache: Cache = Object.values(modules)[0]?.default ?? {};
```

A glob rather than a static import specifically because the file is gitignored: on a clone that has not run the fetcher, a static import is a hard build failure, while a glob matching nothing yields `{}` and degrades to the facade the component already knows how to render.

**Diagnostic route.** Facade mode has several possible causes — no key, no cache, cache present but unreadable — and they are indistinguishable from the rendered page. Surfaces with a build-time cache should expose a small JSON route reporting key presence, per-id build counts, and live values. `hasKey: true` beside `buildCount: 0` identifies this failure in one request.

**A partial recovery is not a fix.** Where a runtime layer (§4.5) supplies some values, it will mask exactly the part of the failure it covers — counts return while items stay missing. Confirm the artifact reached the bundle rather than inferring it from a symptom clearing.

***

## 6. Implementation Phases

### Phase 0 — Shared foundation (already in place)
- [x] `remark-bare-link` plugin
- [x] Provider catalog with frontmatter-as-record format
- [x] OG fetcher (build-time, cached) — used as fallback when provider matchers don't extract a thumbnail/title

### Phase 1 — Tier-A polish (current focus)

#### Phase 1a — Playlist component (full architecture per §4.1.3)
- [ ] Add `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` to `.env` (free quota; ~10k units/day)
- [ ] Build `youtube-playlist-fetcher` parallel to `og-fetcher`: collects unique playlist IDs from the markdown corpus, fetches `playlists` + `playlistItems` (paginated) + `videos` (durations, batched), writes `src/data/youtube-playlist-cache.json`
- [ ] Cache shape: `PlaylistCacheEntry` with title, channel, item count, items[]; TTL configurable per-site (default 30 days)
- [ ] Refactor `YouTubePlaylistEmbed.astro` from "iframe-only" to "Astro shell + Svelte island" architecture: server-rendered header strip + sidebar list, hydrate sidebar interactivity only
- [ ] Implement `PlaylistController.svelte`: postMessage to iframe via YouTube IFrame Player API (`enablejsapi=1`), `playVideoAt(index)` on item click, listen for `onStateChange` to update active highlight; mount with `client:visible`
- [ ] Hide YouTube's built-in sidebar (don't pass `&listType=playlist` to the iframe URL); render our themed sidebar instead
- [ ] Responsive: sidebar to the right at ≥1024px; tablet (768–1023px) keeps inline sidebar with narrower width; mobile uses the §5.9 `MobileFeaturePlaceholder` pattern
- [ ] **Build `MobileFeaturePlaceholder.astro` (cross-cutting per §5.9)** — placeholder slot + full-content slot + label prop; handles slide-in panel, swipe gestures, focus trap, scroll restoration, browser-back integration. First consumer is the playlist sidebar; future sidebar components reuse the same boundary.
- [ ] Failure modes: missing API key → facade fallback; rate-limit → last-known-good cache or facade; private/deleted items → struck-through inactive entries
- [ ] Cap displayed items at 50; show "Show all on YouTube" link when the playlist exceeds the cap

#### Phase 1b — Other Tier-A polish
- [ ] Facade mode wired in `YouTubeEmbed`, `YouTubeShortsEmbed`, `VimeoEmbed` (the playlist component handles facade as a degraded state under Phase 1a)
- [ ] oEmbed enrichment build step that populates title/duration/thumbnail for catalog providers (single-video, Vimeo, Loom) and writes to the OG cache

### Phase 2 — `LinkPreview__Video--{Format}` family
- [ ] `Card` first (richest data shape, biggest payoff)
- [ ] `Row` (CSS variant of Card if data shape allows)
- [ ] `Thumb` (smallest density, used by rollups)
- [ ] `LiveSite` (author opt-in only, lowest priority)

### Phase 3 — `LinkRollup__*` × video
- [ ] Column container (simplest layout)
- [ ] Gallery container (most common production use)
- [ ] ThumbRow horizontal-scroll
- [ ] Carousel (heaviest UX — last)

### Phase 4 — New providers
- [ ] Loom matcher + `LoomEmbed`
- [ ] Future video providers added by extending the catalog only

## 7. Open Questions

1. ~~**Should `YouTubePlaylistEmbed` carry an `index` prop for "start playing item N"?**~~ **Resolved (2026-05-07):** yes. Required for the IFrame API `playVideoAt` integration in §4.1.3.4.
2. ~~**oEmbed at build time or on-demand?**~~ **Resolved (2026-05-07):** build-time, with a per-site TTL config (default 30 days for playlist data; oEmbed for single videos can use the same config). The cache is gitignored; CI rebuilds repopulate.
3. **Do `LinkPreview__Video--*` variants require their own files, or are they CSS variants of one component?** The naming taxonomy implies separate files; pragmatism may collapse them. Decide during Phase 2 implementation.
4. **Carousel keyboard/screenreader contract.** Carousels are the format most likely to ship with a11y bugs. Block on documented keyboard nav (arrow keys, Home/End, focus management on slide change) before merging.
5. **Should the Vimeo channel URL pattern (`vimeo.com/channels/{name}/{id}`) preserve the channel context anywhere in the rendered UI?** Today the matcher discards it. Probably yes for `Card` and `LiveSite`; not needed for `Row`/`Thumb`.
6. **YouTube Data API quota when many playlists exist in the corpus.** Free tier is 10,000 units/day; one playlist costs ~3 units (1 + 1 + 1). Sites with >3,000 unique playlists per build need an upgraded quota or a longer TTL. No action until a real site approaches that scale.
7. **Cache invalidation when an author edits a playlist on YouTube.** TTL-based invalidation will lag — a 30-day TTL means up to 30 days of staleness for title/items. A manual "rebuild playlist cache" script can short-circuit the TTL when the author knows a playlist changed. Out of scope for v1.
