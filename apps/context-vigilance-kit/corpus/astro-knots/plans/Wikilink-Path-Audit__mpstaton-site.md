# Wikilink Path Audit — mpstaton-site

Generated automatically by `sites/mpstaton-site/scripts/audit-wikilinks.ts`. Re-run to refresh: `pnpm --filter mpstaton-site audit-wikilinks` (or `bun scripts/audit-wikilinks.ts` from the site root).

This file is the worklist for the wikilink resolution effort described in `[[Wikilink-Resolution-System]]`. Each unique wikilink path appears exactly once (case-insensitive — variant casings collapse into one entry), even if it shows up in multiple essays.

**For prefix-grouped entries** (the bulk of this doc):

1. Decide whether the path resolves locally (a content collection on this site) or externally (lossless.group, sibling Astro Knots site, etc.).
2. Set `resolved_url:` to the destination URL or local route.
3. Flip `path_resolved: true`.
4. Use the `notes:` field to capture decision rationale, ambiguities, or follow-ups.

Once enough entries within a prefix group resolve consistently, the prefix-level pattern is obvious — that's when the site's `EXTERNAL_DESTINATIONS` config gets written from this audit.

**For bare wikilinks and absolute-path wikilinks** (the two sections at the top): these are not destined for the config — they're triage-worklist items the author addresses in source content (or accepts as unresolvable). Per the operating principle codified in `[[Wikilink-Resolution-System]]`, **unresolved wikilinks render as plain text** in essays. Supporting 40% of the intended wikilinks is better than supporting none.

## Summary

- **Unique wikilink paths:** 354
- **Total occurrences across content:** 495
- **Distinct top-level prefixes:** 15
- **Resolved (rules in `scripts/wikilink-rules.ts`):** 208 / 354 (59%)
- **Deferred (deliberately parked):** 44
- **Remaining to triage:** 102
- **Active rules:** 7 prefix rules, 0 exact rules, 2 deferred prefixes

| Prefix | Unique | Occurrences | Resolved | Deferred | % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `(bare — no prefix)` | 91 | 120 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| `(absolute filesystem paths)` | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| `client-content/` | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0% |

## Bare wikilinks (no prefix)

These are legacy artifacts from before an Obsidian setting that requires path-prefixed wikilinks was enabled. Many point to "stub files" at the vault root that haven't been moved into a folder yet. **The resolver will not attempt to resolve these** — they render as plain text in essays. Three triage options:

1. Open the source file in Obsidian and let Obsidian auto-update the wikilink when you move the stub into a proper folder (`Vocabulary/`, `concepts/`, etc.).
2. Run a future `scripts/fix-bare-wikilinks.ts` (not yet built) that takes a content folder + target prefix and rewrites bare wikilinks in source.
3. Accept that the wikilink renders as plain text until the underlying stub is organized.

You can leave `path_resolved: false` on every entry in this section — they're intentionally non-resolvable. Use `notes:` to flag any specific stub that's a priority to organize.

## Absolute filesystem paths (Obsidian artifacts)

Wikilinks containing absolute Unix paths, almost certainly from a non-Obsidian move/rename of a vault file (an IDE rename, a `git mv`, etc.). Obsidian only auto-updates wikilinks when it observes the move itself; these were stranded. **The resolver treats them as unresolved** (renders as plain text). Fix in source by editing the offending file; Obsidian won't help here.
