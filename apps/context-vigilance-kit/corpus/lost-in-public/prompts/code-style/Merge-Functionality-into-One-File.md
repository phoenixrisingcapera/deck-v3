# Objective:

Preserve and integrate key functionality while streamlining code organization and structure. 

Enable the developers to remove redundant code and redundant files, while assuring changes will be non-breaking by changing references from old files and functions to new files and functions.

Improve coherence and fidelity of the codebase by applying known or observed patterns of naming conventions and code organization to functional code that lacks that consistency and fidelity.  

# Functionality to Preserve
> _While the developers may isolate and point to functionality they know they want to preserver, the AI Assistant is expected to surface any functionality they can observe and surface it through chat dialog._
