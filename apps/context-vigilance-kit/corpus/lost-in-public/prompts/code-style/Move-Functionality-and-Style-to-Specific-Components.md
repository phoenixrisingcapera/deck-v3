# Context

I have moved the `components/vocabulary/VocabularyEntry.astro` component to `components/reference/VocabularyEntry.astro.`

(Let's make sure that doesn't blow up anything.)

### Objective:

Move the functionality and style of both Concepts and Vocabulary currently in  
`site/src/pages/more-about/index.astro`

into two components:

1. `components/reference/ConceptPreviewCard.astro`
2. `components/reference/VocabularyPreviewCard.astro`

into the @components/reference directory.
