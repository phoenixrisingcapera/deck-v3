# Goal  

Design and implement a reusable Question & Answers (Q&A) section for our Astro site, following the established accordion/FAQ interaction pattern.

---

## Requirements

1. **Component Structure**
   - Use a parent Q&A section component that renders a list of Q&A items.
   - Each Q&A item is a dropdown/accordion: the question is a button, the answer is shown/hidden on click.
   - The component must accept data as a prop (array of question/answer objects).

2. **Behavior**
   - Only one answer should be open at a time (single-expand).
   - The first question should be open by default.
   - Clicking a question toggles its answer; opening one closes any other open answer.
   - Keyboard and screen reader accessible (ARIA attributes, focus management).

3. **Styling**
   - Match the FAQ1 section and starwind-accordion style (rounded, border, transition, etc.).
   - Use project design tokens and CSS variables for consistency.
   - Responsive and mobile-friendly.

4. **Data Source**
   - Accept JSON data structured as:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "question": "What is your refund policy?",
         "answer": "You can request a refund within 30 days of purchase."
       }
     ]
     ```
   - Example data should be included in the prompt for testing.

5. **Integration**
   - Provide clear instructions for importing and using the component.
   - Document expected props and data format.

6. **Extensibility**
   - Allow for optional rich text/markdown in answers.
   - Optionally support icons or status badges next to questions.

---

## Example JSON Data

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What do you mean by 'free updates'?",
    "answer": "All future improvements and new features are included at no extra cost."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I contact support?",
    "answer": "You can reach us via email or our support portal, 24/7."
  }
]
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- The section visually and functionally matches the reference FAQ/accordion.
- Only one answer open at a time; top question open by default.
- Data-driven: adding/removing questions is as simple as editing the JSON.
- Fully accessible and responsive.

---

## Additional Notes

- Reference the following files for implementation details and patterns:
  - `/packages/galaxy/src/components/Faq/Faq1.astro`
  - `/packages/galaxy/src/components/starwind/accordion/Accordion.astro`
  - `/site/src/components/reference/Section__QuestionsAnswers.astro`
  - `/site/src/components/reference/QuestionAnswerDropdown.astro`
- Follow the project’s commenting and documentation standards.
- Include a section for future improvements (e.g., multi-expand mode, search/filter).

---

## Next Steps

- Fill out the prompt file with the above structure.
- Iterate: After initial implementation, review with the team and update the prompt for clarity or new requirements.
