# Goals
Create an informative changelog entry that documents changes to code or content in a structured, searchable format.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Frontmatter Structure
```yaml
---
title: 'Brief, descriptive title of changes'
date: YYYY-MM-DD
authors: 
- Author Name
augmented_with: 'Windsurf on Claude 3.5 Sonnet'
files_affected: 623
categories: 
- Reports
- Content Augmentation
tags: 
- Tag1
- Tag2
- Tag3
image_prompt: "A content changelog entry UI with sections for updates, improvements, and editorial notes. Visuals include content cards, timeline markers, and collaborative editing tools, symbolizing organized content history tracking."
---
```

### 2. Content Structure
```markdown
# Summary
Brief overview of changes in 1-2 sentences.

## Changes Made
- Detailed list of specific changes
- Include file paths when relevant
- Note any breaking changes
- Document dependencies added/removed

## Impact
- Better open graph objects make the Cards
- Breadth of coverage of tooling provides more rich information

## Documentation
- Links to related documentation and reports
- Examples of usage
- API changes if applicable

# List of Affected Files

An "Obsidian Flavor" backlink is a "wikilink" that points to a file in the content directory.  It begins and ends with double brackets `[[` and `]]`.  In between, it MUST HAVE THE EXACT relative path from the root of the content directory to the file. THIS MEANS DO NOT INCLUDE "content" as the relative path, even though "content" is the name of the submodule and may show up in the relative path, depending on the working directory you are in when you write the backlink.

Backlinks also have a pipe `|` after the relative path to the file (including the file name and file extension). The pipe is followed by the file name, stripped of any dashes or underscores that are meant to be "safe" spacing characters, and with no extension.  This is the "File Name" in the backlink.

If there are only 10-30 affected files, put them in an unordered list.  If there are more than 30 affected files, just make them comma separated in a continguous paragraph.

## Example

`"[[" ${Path/to/file/File-Name.md|File Name} "]]"`

`content/lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/SVG-Image-Rendering-Issue-Resolution.md`
becomes:
`[[lost-in-public/prompts/workflow/SVG-Image-Rendering-Issue-Resolution.md|SVG Image Rendering Issue Resolution]]`


### 3. Changelog Rules

1. **Specificity**:
   - Use precise, technical language
   - Include version numbers
   - Reference specific files and functions

2. **Completeness**:
   - Document ALL changes
   - Include both additions and removals
   - Note any deprecations

3. **Context**:
   - Explain WHY changes were made
   - Document impact on existing code
   - Note any alternatives considered

4. **Organization**:
   - Group related changes
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Follow section structure

5. **Integration**:
   - Link to related issues/PRs
   - Reference related changelogs
   - Document dependencies
