# Goals
Create an informative changelog entry that documents changes to code or content in a structured, searchable format.

### IMPORTANT: File Location and Naming
1. **Absolute Directory Path:**
   ```
   /Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/content/changelog--code/
   ```

2. **Relative Directory Path:**
   ```
   content/changelog--code/
   ```

3. **Filename Format:**
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD_XX.md
   ```
   Where:
   - `YYYY-MM-DD` is today's date (e.g., 2025-04-07)
   - `XX` is a sequential number (01, 02, 03...) for multiple entries on the same day
   - Example: `2025-04-07_02.md`

4. **How to determine the next number:**
   - List the directory contents to find the highest number for today's date
   - If no entries exist for today, start with `01`
   - If entries exist (e.g., `2025-04-07_01.md`), use the next number (e.g., `2025-04-07_02.md`)

### Implementation Requirements

### 1. Frontmatter Structure

**NOTE**: All category or tag values must be in Train-Case, this is important becasue of how various content processors, publishers, creation and management tools can handle using classifier strings.  

```yaml
---
title: "Brief, descriptive title of changes"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
authors: 
- Author Name # authors must be in an array list syntax
augmented_with: "Windsurf on Claude 3.5 Sonnet"
category: "Technical-Changes | Documentation | Content-Updates" # this is the CATEGORY of the change.
date_created: YYYY-MM-DD # this is the FILESYSTEM record of the date created
date_modified: YYYY-MM-DD # this is the FILESYSTEM record of the date modified
tags: 
- Tag-One
- Tag-Two
- Tag-Three
---
```

### 2. Content Structure

All section delimiters must be in "***" syntax, as "---" is reserved for frontmatter. Including "---" in section delimiters will cause system wide errors that will be difficult to detect and revert.

```markdown
# Summary
Brief overview of changes in 1-2 sentences.

## Why Care
Brief explanation of why the changes are important, how they can be impactful, and why any reader should care.  

# Implementation

## Changes Made
- Detailed list of specific changes
- Include file paths ALWAYS
- Include tree structure output when many files are impacted. 
- Document dependencies added/removed
- Configuration changes

## Technical Details
- Implementation specifics
- Code samples WITH PATHS TO FILES
- Code syntax or style choices that impact readability for others. 
- Performance impacts

## Integration Points
- How changes connect to other components
- Required updates in other areas
- Migration steps if needed

## Documentation
- Links to related documentation
- Examples of usage
- API changes if applicable
```

### 3. Changelog Rules

1. **Specificity**:
   - Use precise, technical language
   - Include version numbers
   - Reference specific files and functions

2. **Completeness**:
   - Document ALL files that received changes
   - Use 'git status' and 'git diff' to "remember" our changes in context window. 
   - Include both additions and removals
   - Note any deprecations

3. **Context**:
   - Explain WHY changes were made
   - Document impact on existing code
   - Note any alternatives considered

4. **Organization**:
   - Group related changes
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Follow section structure

5. **Integration**:
   - Link to related issues/PRs
   - Reference related changelogs
   - Document dependencies

## Example Entries

Example entries can be found in the 
`content/changelog--code` directory.  

Assume that the most recent entries are the best examples.
