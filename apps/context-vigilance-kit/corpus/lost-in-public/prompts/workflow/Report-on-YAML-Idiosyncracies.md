# Higher-Order Objective:

Assure all files in the:
`content/lost-in-public/prompts/` directory
have an image_prompt, then run the 
`generate-banner-images-recraft.py` script for files that lack a banner_image property.

# Task at Hand:

Write a script in 
`tidyverse/tidy-up/tidy-one-property/assure-image-prompts-banner-image/checkForImagePromptsBannerImage.cjs`


That script will Report files that lack an "image_prompt" property and/or a "banner_image" property.

From the directories:

- `content/lost-in-public/prompts/

Report files that lack a
1. "image_prompt" property.
2. "banner_image" property.

using the base patterns and conventions defined in:
`content/lost-in-public/rag-input/Maintain-Consistent-Reporting.md`

## Relevant Previous Directories:
`ai-labs/apis/recraft`

## Relevant Previous Files:

`ai-labs/apis/recraft/generate-banner-images-recraft.py`


# Context:

We have done a lot of scripting, as a team.  We probably ALREADY have code related to the Task-at-Hand.  Let's search the relevant directories for releant code.  

## Standardized reporting template and directory:

`content/lost-in-public/rag-input/Maintain-Consistent-Reporting.md`
`content/reports`
