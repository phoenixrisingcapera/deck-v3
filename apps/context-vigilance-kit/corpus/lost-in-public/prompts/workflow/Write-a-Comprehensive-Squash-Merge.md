**This squash merge preserves a clean master history while retaining the full detail of all development work.**

# CRITICAL WARNING: NEVER OVERRIDE MASTER HISTORY WITH DEVELOPMENT HISTORY

## Absolute Rules for Safe, Clean Squash-Merges

- **NEVER** use `git reset --hard development` or any command that points `master` to the full development branch history. This will ERASE all unique master commits and destroy the curated master timeline. This is IRREVERSIBLE unless you have a backup.
- **ALWAYS** preserve the unique commit history of master. Only changes since the LAST merge from development to master should be squashed and merged.
- **NEVER** fast-forward or force-push master to development unless you are 100% certain there are no unique master commits to preserve. This is almost never the case in a real project.

## Proper, DRY, and Human-Readable Squash-Merge Workflow

### 1. Identify the Last Merge Commit
- Find the last commit where development was merged into master. Use:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline --graph --decorate master
  ```
- Note the commit hash of the last merge (call this `<last-merge>`).

### 2. Review Changes Since Last Merge
- See what will be included in the squash:
  ```bash
  git log <last-merge>..development --oneline
  ```
- Review for any files or changes that should NOT be included.

### 3. Create a Temporary Branch for the Squash
- This is a safety step:
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  git pull origin master
  git checkout -b squash-temp
  ```

### 4. Squash-Merge Changes from Development
- This will stage all changes since `<last-merge>` as one commit:
  ```bash
  git merge --squash development
  ```
- If you only want changes since `<last-merge>`, use an interactive rebase or cherry-pick as needed.

### 5. Write a Comprehensive Commit Message
- List all included features, fixes, and improvements.
- Reference all relevant issues, PRs, and documentation.
- Example:
  ```
  squash: merge all changes from development since <last-merge>
  
  - Feature: ...
  - Fix: ...
  - Refactor: ...
  See commits: <git log <last-merge>..development --oneline>
  ```

### 6. Commit and Test
  ```bash
  git commit -m "<comprehensive message>"
  # Test your build, run all checks
  ```

### 7. Merge or Fast-Forward Master (if safe)
- If master has not diverged, you can fast-forward:
  ```bash
  git checkout master
  git merge squash-temp
  git push origin master
  ```
- If master has diverged, resolve conflicts and only force-push if you are certain.

### 8. Clean Up
- Delete temporary branches after confirming success.

***

# DO NOT EVER:
- DO NOT reset master to development
- DO NOT merge development into master without squashing
- DO NOT force-push master unless you have a backup and are certain

***

# Troubleshooting and Recovery
- If you accidentally overwrite master, use `git reflog` immediately to find the previous commit and restore it.
- Always create a backup branch before destructive operations:
  ```bash
  git branch master-backup
  ```

***

# Summary

- Always preserve master’s unique history.
- Only squash-merge changes since the last merge.
- Never, ever override master with development’s full history.
- Document every squash-merge with a detailed, human-readable commit message.

***

# Example Command Sequence

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b squash-temp
git merge --squash development
# git merge-base master development  # Find <last-merge>
# git log <last-merge>..development --oneline   # Review changes
git checkout master
git merge squash-temp
git checkout --theirs . # prefers the squash-temp branch if conflicts
git add .
# Ask AI Code Assistant to write comprenehsive squash commit message, using this prompt
git commit
git push origin master
```

***

# NEVER OVERRIDE MASTER HISTORY. SQUASH ONLY WHAT’S NEEDED. ALWAYS DOCUMENT.
