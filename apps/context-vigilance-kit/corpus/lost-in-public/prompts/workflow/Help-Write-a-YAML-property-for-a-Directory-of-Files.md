# Context

This prompt extends the permanent conventions and workflow for writing or editing YAML frontmatter in Markdown content files throughout the content library.

### Why this matters:
Missing various properties in YAML frontmatter causes improper or undesired rendering, if not flat out errors, in rendering content in our content-driven application. Errors are a frequent cause of build failures and rendering bugs in content-driven projects. By working within these conventions, we ensure content is easy to maintain, automate, and scale—whether you’re a human contributor or an AI assistant.

### Audience
- Content creators, editors, and developers working with Markdown files in this project.
- AI assistants or automation tools tasked with generating or updating YAML frontmatter.

### Why this prompt:
We have created a successful process to generate images to go with our content.  

#### Workflow
For Large Batches of Files:
Use an LLM API or automation script to add or update YAML properties across many files at once. Always validate changes with a YAML linter before committing.

**For Small Batches or Individual Files:**
Use the chat window in your tool (e.g., Cascade, VS Code, or GitHub Copilot Chat) to generate or edit YAML frontmatter. 

While the AI Assistant is at it as a copywriter, always double-check for:
- Proper opening and closing delimiters (---)
- Correct indentation and syntax
- Compare against a template if one exists, potentially noting required or suggested properties are present and valid.

#### Example:

`content/lost-in-public/prompts`

In the Prompt files, we asked an LLM Chat Client to review the files and to use creativity to write a short, vivid, descriptive "image_prompt" value as a string.  

> `image_prompt: "A bold hero section UI with a striking headline, vibrant call-to-action button, and an engaging background image. The design is modern, clean, and visually impactful, drawing attention to the main message in a web interface."`

We then ran a script to ping the [[Tooling/AI-Toolkit/Generative AI/Recraft|Recraft]] API with that image prompt, and the script returns a "banner_image" value as a url.  

We then use that `banner_image` url to render images in cards and other components that add life to content through images.  

# Task-at-Hand

Write an "image_prompt" for the files in the working directory.  Make it one to four sentences, and try to use visual imagery that will help the Recraft API generate a meaningful, clear corresponding image to the specification.  

## Do not overwrite existing image_prompt values, do not remove any banner_image values.  

Most files will not have an image_prompt value, but for those that do not, write one.   

### Working Directory:
`content/prompts`
