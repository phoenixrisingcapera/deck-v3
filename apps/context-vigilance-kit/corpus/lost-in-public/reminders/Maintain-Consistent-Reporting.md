# Reports always always ALWAYS ALWAYS 

## Output reports to the following directory:
`content/reports/`

## Name the report with the following naming convention:
2025-05-14_Report-Name_01.md where 2025-05-14 is the date, Report-Name is the name of the report, and 01 is the index or count of the report run (e.g. 02, 03, etc.) on the same calendar day. 

# Reuse Reporting Code, Utilities, and Functions

## The Tidyverse Reporting System
We have a reporting system in place that is used by many scripts and observers. Please reuse it. If the code we are writing is in the site submodule, we should copy the reporting code from the tidy-up submodule as precisely as possible. That reporting code in the tidyverse submodule went through many iterations, no need to go through it all again.

It can be found in:
`tidyverse/tidy-up/observers/services/reportingService.cjs`
`tidyverse/observers/utils` // has several utility files.

## The Site Debug and Reporting System
We had to create a Debug System in the site submodule when we were troubleshooting AST transformation in the Unified, Remark, and Rehype render pipelines. Please reuse it, codify it if it is not already codified, and use it as a template for any future debugging and reporting needs.

It can be found in:
`site/src/utils/debugService.cjs`




## Mandatory Utilities

All scripts within `tidyverse/tidy-up` MUST utilize centralized utility modules for consistency and maintainability:

1.  **Path Management (`tidyverse/tidy-up/utils/constants.cjs`):**
    *   This module (to be created) will define and export essential **absolute** path constants.
    *   Key constants include: `MONOREPO_ROOT`, `CONTENT_ROOT`, `REPORTS_DIR`, `CONTENT_TOOLING_DIR`, `ASSETS_SRC_DIR`.
    *   Scripts **MUST** import and use these constants for accessing any file or directory outside their own immediate location.
    *   **CRITICAL:** The use of `__dirname`, `process.cwd()`, or hardcoded relative paths (e.g., `../content`, `src/assets`) for cross-directory access is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**.

2.  **Reporting Functions (`tidyverse/tidy-up/utils/reportUtils.cjs`):**
    *   This module (to be created) will provide standardized reporting functions.
    *   Key functions include:
        *   `formatRelativePath(absoluteFilePath)`: Takes an absolute path and returns the plain text path relative to `CONTENT_ROOT` (e.g., `tooling/AI-Toolkit/Models/Dolphin.md`). This is MANDATORY for listing files in reports.
        *   `writeReport(reportContent, reportNamePrefix)`: Takes the report markdown string and a base name, generates a timestamped filename, ensures `REPORTS_DIR` exists, and writes the report to the correct location (`content/reports/`).

## Mandatory Report Generation

*   **Every script** that performs checks, analysis, or modifications (including asset manipulation) **MUST** generate a Markdown report file summarizing its actions.
*   The report MUST include:
    *   A clear title and date.
    *   Summary statistics (e.g., files scanned, files modified, errors encountered).
    *   Detailed lists of affected files or specific findings.
*   The report **MUST** be written to the standard `REPORTS_DIR` using the `writeReport` utility function.
*   Console logging is acceptable for real-time progress updates but **DOES NOT** replace the mandatory report file.

## File Listing Format in Reports

*   When listing files within a report:
    * **ALWAYS** check to see if there are any syntax or casing modifcations needed to the paths or filenames.  There will be cases where in order for the content team to use Obsidian backlinks to accurately navigate to the files, some modifications may be needed. (e.g. `tooling/AI-Toolkit/Some-File.md` MAY need to become `Tooling/AI Toolkit/Some-File.md`)
    *   **MUST** use Obsidian backlink syntax, formatted as:
        `[[relative/path/to/File-Name-for-Backlink.md|File Name for Backlink]]`
        - The link target is the relative path from the `content/` directory (e.g., `tooling/AI-Toolkit/Some-File.md`).
        - The link text is the file name, with dashes replaced by spaces, extension removed, and title case (e.g., `Some File`).
    *   **MUST** list backlinks in comma-separated paragraphs, not as bullet lists or headers.
    *   **MUST NOT** use Markdown header syntax (e.g., `### tooling/AI-Toolkit/Some-File.md`).
    *   **MUST NOT** use plain text paths as the primary format (plain text may be included for compatibility, but the canonical format is the backlink).

    **Example:**
    ```markdown
    [[tooling/AI-Toolkit/Some-File.md|Some File]], [[vocabulary/Example-File.md|Example File]], [[tooling/Another-Example.md|Another Example]]
    ```

## Observer and Pipeline Logging & Reporting Standard

### Conditional Console Logging
- All scripts and observer steps must keep all `console.log` statements in the codebase for stepwise debugging and traceability.
- Logging must be controlled by user-configurable flags (e.g., `services.logging` in config), allowing per-step and per-directory toggling without code deletion.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  services: {
    logging: {
      addSiteUUID: true,
      openGraph: false
    }
  }
  if (logging?.addSiteUUID) {
    console.log('After addSiteUUID:', updatedFrontmatter);
  }
  ```
- This ensures logs can be enabled/disabled as needed for any pipeline step, supporting rapid debugging while keeping the codebase DRY and auditable.

### Reporting Service Integration
- All file mutation operations (e.g., frontmatter writes) must accept and use a `reportingService` parameter.
- The reporting service must be called with full context (file path, new frontmatter, template order, etc.) after each mutation.
- The reporting service is responsible for logging and tracking events such as YAML property reordering, frontmatter changes, and other structural mutations.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  reportingService.logFileYamlReorder({
    filePath,
    previousOrder,
    newOrder,
    changedFields
  });
  ```
- This provides a robust audit trail for all significant changes, supporting debugging, traceability, and confidence in the automation pipeline.

**These standards are mandatory for all scripts and observer/pipeline operations that mutate file metadata or structure.**
