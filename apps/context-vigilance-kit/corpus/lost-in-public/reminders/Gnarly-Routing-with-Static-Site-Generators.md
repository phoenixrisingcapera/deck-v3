Pseudo-code for route resolution  
1. Check if path matches existing curated routes → serve normally  
2. If not found, check content directory for exact path match  
3. If found, serve content with appropriate layout  
4. If still not found, check for redirects/aliases  
5. Finally, show 404 with suggestions

Note: more specific and longer path resolutions get priority in Astro, which may be counterintuitive to some.
