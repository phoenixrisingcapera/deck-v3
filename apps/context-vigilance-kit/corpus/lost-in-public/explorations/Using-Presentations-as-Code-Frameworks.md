This is a rich topic. Presentations specifically have a compelling cluster of text-native, agent-writable formats. Here's a breakdown:

## The Markdown-as-Slides Ecosystem

The most agent-fluent presentation formats are all built on Markdown, using a simple delimiter convention (`---`) to separate slides. The **big three** are:

- **[Marp](https://marp.app)** — a Markdown Presentation Ecosystem that converts `.md` files to slides, PDF, or HTML. Agents write pure Markdown with a YAML front matter block to control theme and layout. It's the simplest entry point. [^rm8444] [^my4niu]
- **[Slidev](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax)** — uses `.md` files with embedded Vue components, Mermaid/PlantUML diagrams, LaTeX math, and code highlighting natively. An agent can express rich, developer-focused decks in a single text file — including embedded Mermaid inside a slide. [^8dcvz4] [^z5dzbv]
- **[Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com)** — plain Markdown chunks separated by `---`, rendered in-browser, with speaker notes after `???`. The most minimal of the three — nearly zero syntax beyond standard Markdown. [^rr4c8y] [^ut1ub9]

All three are ideal for agents because the format is **nearly identical to Markdown the agent already knows** — the only new concept is the slide-separator and a handful of layout hints.

## Academic / Precision Track: Beamer (LaTeX)

**Beamer** is LaTeX's presentation class. Agents trained on academic corpora have strong implicit fluency with it — it's the standard format for physics, mathematics, and CS conference talks. A slide is a `frame` environment; equations, citations, and theorems render natively. For users collaborating with an agent on a technical lecture or paper presentation, Beamer lets the agent handle layout logic that would be tedious in PowerPoint. It compiles to PDF with precisely controlled typography. [^6ca3q2] [^vk63fk]

## The "Diagrams as Slides" Formats

These blur the boundary between whiteboard-style canvases and presentations:

- **[Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/markdown/)** HTML-with-Markdown — slides are `<section>` elements in HTML, but content can be authored in Markdown via `data-markdown`. Agents can write both the HTML structure and the slide content, giving fine-grained control over animation, layout, and speaker notes. [^w95x3k] [^ka6115]
- **Slidev's `.md` + frontmatter** — the closest thing to a true "presentation as code" spec right now, explicitly designed to be written by developers (and agents) rather than clicked through a GUI. [^ydrq6n]

## Agent Fluency Comparison

| Format | Syntax | Agent Writes | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Marp** `.md` | Markdown + YAML front matter | Easily — nearly pure Markdown | Quick, styled decks |
| **Slidev** `.md` | Markdown + Vue snippets | Mostly — needs Vue component awareness | Developer / code-heavy talks |
| **Remark.js** `.md` | Plain Markdown + `---` | Trivially — zero new syntax | Minimal, no-frills decks |
| **Reveal.js** HTML | HTML + optional Markdown | Moderately — HTML structure required | Custom animated decks |
| **Beamer** `.tex` | LaTeX | Strongly for math/academic content | Conference, academic talks |

The key pattern matching your framing: **Marp and Slidev are exactly the "diagrams as code" equivalent for presentations** — a plain text file an agent can read, reason about, modify, and generate, which then renders visually through a separate tool. Slidev in particular is becoming a go-to for agent-generated technical presentations because it natively embeds Mermaid diagrams, meaning an agent can compose an entire talk — narrative, code blocks, and architecture diagrams — in one cohesive Markdown file.

Perfect — this is exactly the kind of domain where agent-fluent formats are proliferating. The analytics/data-viz community has created several powerful text-based specs:
