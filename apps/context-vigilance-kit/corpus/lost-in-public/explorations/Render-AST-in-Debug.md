image_prompt: A robot orchestra conductor in a suit is commanding a swarm of different
  bugs, that are climbing up trees that are growing all different directions.  Each
  tree has the acronym AST carved into its trunks.  At the top of the image, there
  is a banner that states `Abstract Syntax Trees.`

# Objective

Before implementing callout rendering, we need to understand exactly how the AST looks at each stage of processing. This exploration will:

1. Add debug logging to show the AST structure:
   - After initial markdown parsing
   - After each remark plugin
   - After rehype conversion
   - Before final HTML rendering

2. Focus on understanding:
   - How blockquotes are represented in the AST
   - Where callout syntax appears in the node structure
   - What node types we need to work with
   - Best points to intercept for transformation

3. Create a clean baseline without any transformation logic:
   - Remove existing callout handling code
   - Add comprehensive debug output
   - Document the AST structure at each stage

# Implementation Plan

1. Remove existing callout transformation code
2. Add debug logging to `[vocabulary].astro`
3. Add debug logging to each remark plugin
4. Create test markdown files with various callout patterns
5. Document the AST structure we observe

# Success Criteria

- Clear visibility of AST at each processing stage
- Understanding of where callout syntax appears
- Documentation of node types and structure
- Clean baseline for implementing new transformation approach
