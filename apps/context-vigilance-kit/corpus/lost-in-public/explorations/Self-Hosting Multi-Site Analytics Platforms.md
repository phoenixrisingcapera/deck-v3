## Analytics Platforms for Multi-Site Use

Based on your "show don't tell" ethos and need to track interest across ~20 sites without enterprise-level complexity, here's your shortlist. [^o1vaum] [^m97et3] [^73rn2h] [^v61rti]

### Best Overall Matches

**[[Tooling/Software Development/Lego-Kit Engineering Tools/Umami|Umami]]** [^b1v13b] [^o1vaum]
- Open-source (MIT license), self-host or cloud
- Cloud pricing starts around $20/month for multiple sites
- Extremely lightweight, single-page dashboard
- No cookies, GDPR-compliant by default
- Node.js-based, works with PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Strong API for custom integrations
- Actively developed since 2020, now has paid cloud option

**[[Tooling/Enterprise Jobs-to-be-Done/Fathom Analytics]]** [^5pp90x] [^s9fv5p] [^japbr0]
- $15/month for up to 50 sites (flat rate, not per-site)
- Privacy-first, no cookie banners needed
- Forever data retention even on basic plan
- Ecommerce/event tracking included
- Perfect for agencies - best sites-per-dollar ratio
- Not self-hostable, but extremely low maintenance

**[[Tooling/Enterprise Jobs-to-be-Done/OpenPanel]]** [^v61rti] [^o1vaum]
- Combines web + product analytics ([[Tooling/Enterprise Jobs-to-be-Done/Mixpanel]]-like features)
- AGPL-3.0 license, self-host free
- Cloud starts at $2.50/month
- Real-time tracking, cookieless
- Event tracking beyond just pageviews
- Newer but production-ready

### Established Heavy Hitters

**[[Tooling/Enterprise Jobs-to-be-Done/Plausible|Plausible]]** [^o1vaum] [^v61rti]
- AGPL-3.0, self-host or cloud ($9/month starting)
- Ultra-simple, privacy-first pageview analytics
- Clean dashboard, real-time data
- Requires ClickHouse database (slightly more complex to self-host)
- Most similar to what you've seen

**[[Tooling/Enterprise Jobs-to-be-Done/Matomo|Matomo]]** [^4y4gn9] [^5rjo6s] [^o1vaum]
- GPL-3.0, most mature option (used by EU Commission)
- Self-host free, cloud €29/month
- Most feature-complete Google Analytics replacement
- Can import historical GA data
- Heavier infrastructure requirements
- 1M+ websites use it

**[[PostHog]]** [^c3wunh] [^zwi6fq] [^o1vaum]
- MIT license, free self-host
- Cloud has generous free tier (1M events/month)
- Product analytics + web analytics + session replay + feature flags
- More developer-focused, might be overkill
- Supports multi-domain tracking with some setup [^fglc24] [^tr37w4]
- Best if you want experimentation capabilities

### Lighter Alternatives Worth Knowing

**[[Simple Analytics]]** [^jo8hou] [^b2kvpc]
- $5-$19/month tiers, agency plan available
- One-line script, no events manager
- Privacy guarantees (no cookies, no IP storage)
- Treats each subdomain as separate site
- Less customization than others

**[[Pirsch Analytics]]** [^o1vaum]
- Server-side tracking (works with ad blockers)
- Go-based, AGPL-3.0
- Cookieless fingerprinting approach
- Unique advantage: client-side blockers don't affect it

### Your Best Bets

Given your profile - technical sophistication, "just want it to work," willing to pay to avoid maintenance, need multi-site - I'd prioritize:

1. **Fathom** if you want zero-think SaaS (50 sites for $15/month is absurd value)
2. **Umami** if you want the self-host option with good cloud alternative
3. **OpenPanel** if you want product analytics depth beyond pageviews

All three handle multi-domain elegantly, won't require per-site setup complexity, and align with your "track what's getting traction" use case. [^73rn2h] [^v61rti]
