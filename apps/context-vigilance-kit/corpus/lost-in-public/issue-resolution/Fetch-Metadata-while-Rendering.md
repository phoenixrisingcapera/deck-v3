# Fixing Missing Author Metadata on Custom Collection Pages

## 1. What We Were Trying To Do and Why

We aimed to ensure that author metadata (name, avatar, etc.), specified in the frontmatter of Markdown files for custom content collections like "prompts" and "specs", would render correctly on their respective article pages (e.g., `/vibe-with/prompts/some-prompt-slug`).

The author information was present in the Markdown files (e.g., `authors: ["Michael Staton"]`) but was not appearing on the rendered pages. This was impacting content attribution and user experience.

## 2. Incorrect Attempts and Understanding

Our initial efforts focused on the wrong parts of the rendering pipeline:

*   **Misdiagnosis 1: `OneArticleOnPage.astro` or `AuthorHandle.astro`:** We initially suspected the issue was within the final rendering components, `OneArticleOnPage.astro` or `AuthorHandle.astro`. We modified `OneArticleOnPage.astro` to flexibly handle `author` (string) or `authors` (array) in its `data` prop. This was a useful refinement but didn't solve the root cause because the author data wasn't reaching this component at all.

*   **Misdiagnosis 2: Normalization in `OneArticle.astro`:** We then correctly identified that the `data` prop being passed to `OneArticleOnPage.astro` was missing author information. We added author normalization logic (similar to `ChangelogLayout.astro`) into the `OneArticle.astro` layout. This ensured that if author data *was* present in the `data` prop received by `OneArticle.astro`, it would be correctly formatted as an `authors` array. However, server-side logs showed that the `data` prop arriving at `OneArticle.astro` *still* lacked author fields for the affected collections.
    ```astro
    // site/src/layouts/OneArticle.astro - Added normalization
    // ... (script section)
    const normalizeDataWithAuthors = (pageData) => {
      if (!pageData) return { authors: [] };
      let authorList = [];
      if (pageData.authors) {
        authorList = Array.isArray(pageData.authors)
          ? pageData.authors
          : [pageData.authors];
      } else if (pageData.author) {
        authorList = [pageData.author];
      }
      return {
        ...pageData,
        authors: authorList,
      };
    };
    const normalizedData = normalizeDataWithAuthors(data);
    // ...
    // (template section)
    <Component 
      content={transformedMdast}
      data={normalizedData} // Passed normalizedData
      articleHeading={title} 
    >
    ```
    This was a necessary step for robust data handling but didn't fix the upstream problem of missing data.

## 3. The "Aha!" Moment: Tracing Data Flow from Dynamic Routes

The breakthrough came when we realized that the "prompts" and "specs" collections were not standard Astro content collections located in `src/content/` with a `src/content/config.ts`. Instead, they were handled by a unified dynamic route: `site/src/pages/vibe-with/[collection]/[...slug].astro`.

This dynamic route component was responsible for:
1.  Fetching entries using `getCollection()` (which worked, indicating Astro recognized them as collections somehow, likely via `astro.config.mjs` or implicit setup).
2.  Processing these entries in `getStaticPaths` and for page rendering.
3.  Passing data to the `OneArticle.astro` layout.

Upon inspecting `site/src/pages/vibe-with/[collection]/[...slug].astro`, we found that while it correctly fetched the full entry data (including all frontmatter like `authors`) using `getCollection()` and `getEntry()`, it was constructing a *new, minimal* `contentData` object to pass to `OneArticle.astro`. This new object *only* contained `path`, `id`, and `collection`, omitting all other frontmatter fields.

**Original problematic code in `site/src/pages/vibe-with/[collection]/[...slug].astro`:**
```javascript
// ... inside the IIFE for rendering
  const contentData = {
    path: Astro.url.pathname,
    id: processedEntry.id,
    collection: finalCollection,
    // !!! All other frontmatter from processedEntry.data (like authors) was missing here !!!
  };

  return (
    <Layout /* ... */ >
      <OneArticle
        /* ... */
        data={contentData} // This data prop was incomplete
      />
    </Layout>
  );
```

## 4. The Final Solution

The fix was to ensure that the `contentData` object constructed in `site/src/pages/vibe-with/[collection]/[...slug].astro` included all the original frontmatter from `processedEntry.data`.

We modified the `contentData` assignment to spread `processedEntry.data` first, then add/override specific fields like `path`, `id`, and `collection`:

**Corrected code in `site/src/pages/vibe-with/[collection]/[...slug].astro`:**
```javascript
// ... inside the IIFE for rendering
  const contentData = {
    ...processedEntry.data, // Spread all frontmatter from the processed entry
    path: Astro.url.pathname,    // Override/add path if necessary
    id: processedEntry.id,       // Override/add id if necessary
    collection: finalCollection, // Override/add collection if necessary
  };

  return (
    <Layout /* ... */ >
      <OneArticle
        /* ... */
        data={contentData} // Now data prop contains full frontmatter
      />
    </Layout>
  );
```

**Summary of the Data Flow Fix:**
1.  **`site/src/pages/vibe-with/[collection]/[...slug].astro`**: Now correctly passes the *full* frontmatter (including `authors`) from the Markdown file to `OneArticle.astro` via the `contentData` object.
2.  **`site/src/layouts/OneArticle.astro`**: Receives the complete frontmatter. Its `normalizeDataWithAuthors` function ensures `authors` is consistently an array.
3.  **`site/src/components/articles/OneArticleOnPage.astro`**: Receives the normalized data with an `authors` array and passes it to `AuthorHandle.astro`.
4.  **`site/src/components/basics/AuthorHandle.astro`**: Renders the author information.

This change ensured that the complete frontmatter, including author details, was propagated through the custom dynamic routing and layout hierarchy, allowing the author metadata to be rendered as intended.
