lede: The two slide-deck layouts declare their own `<html>` and never set `data-mode`,
  so the eight `/slides/*` pages ignore light/dark entirely.
summary: Found while moving the anti-FOUC mode script into <head> on 2026-08-23. MarkdownSlideDeck.astro
  and OneSlideDeck.astro each open their own <html> element rather than going through
  BoilerPlateHTML.astro, so they never receive the mode script, never carry data-mode,
  and do not respond to the mode toggle. Pre-existing and unrelated to the flash fix.
  Parked as low priority — decks are visually self-contained and currently look intentional.

## What was observed

`src/layouts/BoilerPlateHTML.astro` owns the site's `<html>` element and, as of
2026-08-23, the inline script in `<head>` that applies the stored light/dark mode
before first paint. Two other layouts declare their own `<html>` instead:

| Layout | Line | Opening tag |
|---|---|---|
| `src/layouts/MarkdownSlideDeck.astro` | 33 | `<html lang="en">` |
| `src/layouts/OneSlideDeck.astro` | 23 | `<html lang="en" data-theme="water">` |

Neither sets `data-mode`, and neither contains any `localStorage` mode read. A
sweep of the production build confirms the eight `/slides/*` pages are among the
seventeen that ship without the head mode script.

Note that `OneSlideDeck.astro` uses `data-theme="water"` where the rest of the
site uses a `theme-water` class plus `data-mode` — so the decks are off the theme
convention as well as the mode one.

## Why it matters

Toggling to light mode leaves the decks unchanged. Anyone reading a deck after
switching modes elsewhere on the site gets an inconsistent surface. Since decks
are the fundraise-facing artifact, that inconsistency is more visible to outside
readers than it would be on an internal page.

The decks *do* render `Header.astro`, so they picked up the logo fix from the same
2026-08-23 change. It is only the mode/theme wiring they miss.

## Why it is parked

The decks are visually self-contained and currently read as deliberately dark, so
nothing looks broken today. This is a consistency debt, not a defect.

## Likely fix

Route both deck layouts through `BoilerPlateHTML.astro` rather than opening their
own `<html>`, which would give them the head mode script for free. If a deck needs
to force a mode regardless of user preference, that should be an explicit prop on
the shared boilerplate rather than a separate `<html>`.
