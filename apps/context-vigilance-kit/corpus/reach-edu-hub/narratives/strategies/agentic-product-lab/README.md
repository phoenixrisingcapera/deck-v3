title: NCAD Agentic Product Development Lab
lede: Apprenticeship Degrees need a different technology stack than traditional or
  even online universities — one that integrates work and learning, gives employers
  visibility, and delivers chunked, assessable learning to busy working adults while
  still meeting credit-bearing accreditation. Historically that stack could only be
  built by expensive software-engineering teams. As of 2026, agentic 'vibe coding'
  tools let designers and domain experts prototype working software themselves. So
  the people closest to the problem — apprenticeship, industry-skills, and adult-education
  experts across NCAD's member network — can now prototype and build momentum on new
  pieces of that stack. This is the proposal to stand up that capability as a shared
  lab.

# NCAD Agentic Product Development Lab

> **DRAFT — seed for deck design.** A `strategies`-collection narrative, but a

## The through-line

Three things are true at once, and together they make a new capability obvious.

1. **The Apprenticeship Degree runs on a different stack.** It is not a
   traditional campus, and not even an online program. It needs software that few
   incumbents built for: it has to *integrate work and learning* (day-to-day
   application is the curriculum), [^4847ba] give *employers visibility and a way
   to encourage* their apprentices, and deliver *chunked, convenient learning and
   assessment* to busy working adults — all while still satisfying credit-bearing
   accreditation. Legacy LMSs, university SISs, and online-program platforms each
   solve part of this, none solve the whole.

2. **Who can build software has changed.** Until very recently, turning a domain
   insight into working software required hiring an expensive engineering team.
   "Vibe coding" — building software by describing intent to an AI — was named in
   early 2025, but the tools only matured into something a *non-engineer* can ship
   real prototypes with by 2026 (Cursor, v0, Lovable, Bolt, Replit Agent, Claude
   Code, and peers). [^b71a46] [^8cb194] [^e76b45] Engineers still matter — for
   hardening, scale, security, integration — but they are **no longer the gate on
   prototyping.** [^3675cf] ⚠ VERIFY the "vibe coding" attribution/date and tool
   landscape before citing.

3. **The right people are now the builders.** The expertise that actually knows
   what the apprenticeship stack needs lives in apprenticeship, industry-skills,
   and adult-education practitioners — not in a generic software shop. For the
   first time, those domain experts can prototype the thing they understand,
   instead of writing a spec and waiting on a backlog. The payoff is fivefold:
   more accurate product definition, closer understanding of the problem and
   use case, faster speed into the end-user's hands, a higher likelihood of
   rich stakeholder feedback — and authentic motivation: not an engineer doing
   their job, but a visionary realizing a vision.

**= The NCAD Agentic Product Development Lab.** A shared capability, hosted by
the National Center for the Apprenticeship Degree, [^97559d] where domain experts
from across NCAD's member network use agentic tools to prototype, test, and
circulate new pieces of the Apprenticeship Degree technology stack — with
software engineers brought in to harden what proves out.

## Why this belongs at NCAD specifically

NCAD (launched by Reach University in 2024) exists to **launch and scale**
Apprenticeship Degrees, and already runs partnership development and employer
engagement across a **member network**. [^a42a6b] [^ef66be] ⚠ VERIFY current
member count/roster. That network is exactly the asset a lab needs: a shared
problem, many institutions hitting the same stack gaps independently, and a
neutral center to pool the prototypes so no single member rebuilds what another
already proved.

## How the lab works (proposed)

- **Domain experts prototype.** Practitioners describe the workflow they need;
  agentic tools produce a working prototype in hours/days, not a quarter.
- **Test with real cohorts/employers** inside member programs — the apprentices
  and employers are right there.
- **Circulate across members.** Working prototypes are shared through NCAD so the
  network compounds instead of duplicating.
- **Engineers harden the winners.** What proves out gets production-grade
  treatment (security, scale, accreditation-grade data integrity). Prototyping is
  decoupled from engineering; engineering is reserved for what's earned its way
  there.

## Candidate first builds (the stack gaps)

Drawn from the "different stack" requirements — to be prioritized with members:

- **Work ↔ credit mapping** — capture day-to-day on-the-job work and map it to
  competencies / credit hours in an accreditation-legible way. ⚠ time-based
  Registered Apprenticeship requires a minimum of ~144 hours of related
  instruction per year; competency-based pathways exist — VERIFY and design to
  both. [^36c77b]
- **Employer visibility & encouragement** — a lightweight dashboard so a
  supervisor can see and nudge an apprentice's progress.
- **Chunked delivery + assessment** — microlearning and stackable assessment
  sized for shifts and busy adults, not semester blocks.
- **Evidence capture for accreditation** — turn messy work artifacts into the
  documentation accreditors expect.

**Voice-first assessment & evidence capture (a distinctive angle).** Reach's
current degree populations — teachers and nurses — are the archetypal on-the-go
working adult: their day is real-time application with little time to sit and
write, they move between classes or rounds, and their learning windows are the
commute and small bits of in-between time. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech are
unusually well-suited here, and only recently good enough: **speech-to-text**
lets an apprentice *capture evidence in the moment* (a quick spoken reflection
after a lesson or a shift) which the stack turns into accreditation-ready
documentation — no dissertation required; **text-to-speech** turns the commute
into learning time. Voice meets the working adult where they already are, and
cuts the single biggest friction in work-based assessment: finding time to write
it down. This is a natural early Forge build and a differentiator versus
text-first incumbent tooling.

## The ask

Charter and fund the lab: a small standing capability (domain-expert builders +
part-time engineering + tool budget) hosted at NCAD, governed by and serving the
member network. Grant-funded, shared-good output. (Framing stays philanthropic /
grant-seeking — this is shared infrastructure for the field, not a commercial bet.)

## Proposed slide outline (Scroll-UI first, ~10 slots)

1. **Cover** — NCAD Agentic Product Development Lab (or the chosen name).
2. **A different stack** — what the Apprenticeship Degree needs that incumbents
   didn't build (the three requirements + accreditation).
3. **The gap today** — legacy LMS / SIS / online-program tools each cover a slice.
4. **Who builds has changed** — the vibe-coding shift; prototyping decoupled from
   engineering teams.
5. **Engineers still matter** — what they own (harden/scale/secure) vs. what
   domain experts now own (prototype).
6. **The right builders** — apprenticeship / industry-skills / adult-ed experts.
7. **The lab** — the proposal, one screen: domain experts + agentic tools +
   NCAD network.
8. **How it works** — prototype → test with cohorts/employers → circulate →
   harden.
9. **First builds** — the candidate stack gaps to prototype first.
10. **The ask** — charter + fund the shared lab.

## Core messages (one-liners to thread through the deck)

- "The Apprenticeship Degree runs on a different stack — and nobody built it."
- "Vibe coding moved prototyping from the engineering team to the domain expert."
- "The people who understand the problem can finally build the thing."
- "Prototype with experts; harden with engineers."
- "One network, one lab — so no member rebuilds what another already proved."

## Open questions / decide before deck build

- **The name.** Working title is descriptive. Catchier candidates:
  - **The Apprenticeship Stack Lab** (says exactly what it builds)
  - **NCAD Forge** (a forge = where things get made; short, memorable — and
    already the corpus strategy slug, `ncad-forge`)
  - **NCAD Build Lab** / **The Workbench** (the work-based pun)
  - **NCAD Agentic Lab**
  Recommendation: lead with a catchy name + the descriptive line as subtitle
  (e.g. "NCAD Forge — an agentic product lab for the apprenticeship stack").
- **Audience emphasis** — pitch primarily to *members* (join/contribute) or to
  *funders* (charter it)? Changes the ask slide.
- **Governance** — who owns IP / the shared prototypes across members?
- **Scope guardrails** — what the lab does NOT do (not a replacement for members'
  own systems; not production engineering on day one).
