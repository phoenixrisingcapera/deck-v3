lede: TS 6 forced moduleResolution bundler and a node types entry — and revealed esbuild
  had been silently dropping the Freepik stylesheet.
summary: 'Post-hoc record of a TypeScript 6 dependency upgrade in image-gin: four
  numbered findings, each with the fix that was applied. Read it before repeating
  the upgrade in a sibling plugin — the tsconfig change and the Uint8Array-versus-ArrayBuffer
  typing conflict will recur, and the silently-ignored CSS import is a class of bug
  worth grepping for elsewhere. Also notes the known-cosmetic @codemirror peer-dep
  warnings that can be safely ignored.'

  1. tsconfig.json — TS 6 deprecated moduleResolution: "node" and bare baseUrl. Switched to
  moduleResolution: "bundler" (correct for esbuild) and dropped baseUrl + paths (the paths entry just
   re-stated the default node_modules lookup). Also added "types": ["node"] because TS 6 + bundler
  resolution no longer auto-includes @types/node — without this, Buffer, require, path, fs,
  child_process were all undefined.
  2. src/services/imageCacheService.ts — fixed two pre-existing strict-TS errors (unused Vault
  import; unused settings field). The unused-field fix actually wires the service to respect
  settings.imageCache.cacheFolder instead of a hardcoded path — same default value, but the
  user-configurable setting now does something.
  3. src/services/imageCacheService.ts & src/services/recraftImageService.ts — vault.createBinary
  calls: new @types/node types Uint8Array as Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike> which no longer satisfies
  Obsidian's ArrayBuffer parameter. Pass arrayBuffer directly in one spot, bytes.buffer as
  ArrayBuffer in the other (safe — new Uint8Array(length) always allocates a real ArrayBuffer).
  4. src/styles/current-file-modal.css + src/modals/FreepikModal.ts — the import
  '../styles/freepik.css' in FreepikModal was being silently ignored by esbuild (it warned about it
  on every prior build), so freepik styles were never reaching users. Removed the JS import and added
   @import './freepik.css' to the CSS entry point so the styles actually ship now.

  Known cosmetic warnings (not failures): obsidian 1.12.3 declares peer deps on slightly different
  @codemirror/state and @codemirror/view patch versions than what got installed. These are
  externalized in esbuild so they don't affect the build, but if you ever want them to align you can
  pnpm add -D @codemirror/state@6.5.0 @codemirror/view@6.38.6.
