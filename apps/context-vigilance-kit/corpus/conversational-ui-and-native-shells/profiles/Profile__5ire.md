  may need: (1) the in-progress SQLite/LanceDB → PGlite/Drizzle/pgvector migration,
  including the reusable `legacyId` + `onConflictDoNothing` idempotent-migration idiom
  and exactly which domains have not crossed over (chats, messages, bookmarks, search);
  (2) the MCP client — SDK-native stdio and streamable-HTTP transports, a retry/abort
  connection state machine, and reconnection driven by PGlite `live.changes` on the
  `servers` table; (3) the minimal community marketplace (a static `mcpsvr.com/servers.json`
  feed with a 24-hour TTL cache) whose install path converges on the same `createServer`

# 5ire — Profile

A profile of 5ire as it lives in this study (`studies/conversational-ui-and-native-shells/5ire/`, pinned at `c7fabb9`, tag-derived version `v0.15.4-5-gc7fabb9`). Cites pinned paths so you can jump to source rather than trust paraphrase. Included as the study's **Electron comparison point** — its local-persistence story and MCP-server-marketplace maturity are the load-bearing reasons it's here, despite the study otherwise leaning Tauri. Read alongside `Profile__Dive.md` (Tauri+Electron dual-shell, MCP host) and `Profile__Anything-Llm.md` (Electron, workspace-switching).

## Characterizing the license

`LICENSE:1-6` is explicit: **not** MIT. It's Apache License 2.0 **plus additional conditions** the file calls "5ire Community Edition" terms — `package.json:11` echoes this as `"license": "Modified Apache-2.0"`. The additional terms (`LICENSE:16-33`) require that modified/redistributed versions not use the "5ire Brand," and mandate a **commercial license** if you (a) serve enterprise clients (>10 users), (b) embed 5ire in hardware/products for sale, or (c) handle government/education procurement with sensitive data. Section 3.3 also has contributors grant 5ire "exclusive rights to dual-license" their contributions and waive patent claims against 5ire's commercial use. This is a source-available / BUSL-adjacent license, not a permissive OSS license — treat any reuse of 5ire code accordingly.

## TL;DR

5ire is a **desktop Electron chat client and MCP client** whose defining architectural fact right now is that it's **mid-migration between two entirely different persistence stacks**, visible directly in the source tree: a legacy `better-sqlite3` database (`src/main/sqlite.ts`) still serving conversations, messages, and bookmarks over a raw-SQL IPC bridge, alongside a new Postgres-flavored `PGlite` + Drizzle ORM layer (`src/main/database/index.ts`, `src/main/database/schema/tables.ts`) that has already absorbed knowledge collections, documents, document-chunk embeddings (via `pgvector`), and — notably — **MCP server configuration**, which is fully modern. A dedicated `LegacyDataMigrator` (`src/main/services/legacy-data-migrator.ts`) copies rows across on startup, one domain at a time, with idempotency tracked via `legacyId` unique indexes and persisted migration-completion flags — but as of this pin, it does **not** migrate chats, messages, or bookmarks. Those still live entirely in SQLite, and full-text search over them is a hand-rolled `LIKE '%term%'` scan, not FTS5 or `tsvector`.

On the MCP side, 5ire is one of the more complete implementations in this study: a real `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `Client` over `StdioClientTransport`/`StreamableHTTPClientTransport` (`src/main/services/mcp-connections-manager.ts:1-3,81-96`), retry-with-backoff connection logic (`#connect`, `mcp-connections-manager.ts:104-204`), and — because MCP server *config* already lives in PGlite — **reactive reconnection driven by the database's own live-query changefeed** (`driver.live.changes(...)`, `mcp-connections-manager.ts:266-320`): editing a server row in the `servers` table causes the manager to diff columns and reconnect/disconnect automatically, no manual "refresh servers" call needed anywhere in the app. Layered on top is a genuine **community marketplace**: `useMCPServerMarketStore.fetchServers()` (`src/stores/useMCPServerMarketStore.ts:22-43`) does a plain `fetch('https://mcpsvr.com/servers.json')` against the separate `nanbingxyz/mcpsvr` repo, cached client-side for 24 hours, filtered/searched in `ToolMarketDrawer.tsx`, and installed via a callback that writes a new row into the same `servers` table the connections manager is already watching.

If you want one sentence: **5ire pairs one of this study's most complete MCP-client implementations — SDK-native transports, DB-change-driven reconnection, and a live community server marketplace fetched from `mcpsvr.com` — with a persistence layer caught mid-flight from raw-SQL SQLite to a PGlite/Drizzle/pgvector stack, where the newer, more capable database already owns "servers" and RAG documents but has not yet absorbed chats, messages, bookmarks, or search, which still run as string-matched `LIKE` scans over a legacy `5ire.db` file reached through an ad hoc `db-all`/`db-run`/`db-get` IPC surface.**

## Local persistence — a database mid-migration, visible in the diff between two files

- **Legacy store: one `better-sqlite3` file, opened with WAL mode, exposed as raw SQL over IPC.** `initLegacyDatabase()` (`src/main/sqlite.ts:9-12`) opens `<userData>/5ire.db` and hand-writes `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements for `folders`, `chats`, `messages`, `bookmarks`, `prompts`, `usages`, `knowledge_collections`, `knowledge_files`, `chat_knowledge_rels` (`sqlite.ts:14-200`), followed by ad hoc `alertTableChats`/`alertTableMessages`/`alertTableBookmarks`/`alertTableFolders` functions (`sqlite.ts:202-282`) that `PRAGMA table_info` each table and `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` when a column introduced in a later version is missing — a migration system built from manual, dated `if` checks rather than a migration framework. `database.pragma("journal_mode = WAL")` (`sqlite.ts:308`) is the one concession to concurrent-access performance. The whole thing is reachable from the renderer only through four generic `ipcMain.handle` verbs — `db-all`, `db-run`, `db-transaction`, `db-get` (`sqlite.ts:311-373`) — meaning the renderer constructs and ships raw SQL strings across the IPC boundary (see `useBookmarkStore.ts` below), not typed commands.
- **New store: PGlite (Postgres-in-WASM) + Drizzle ORM + pgvector, with live queries.** `Database.#init()` (`src/main/database/index.ts:47-146`) creates a `PGlite` instance backed by `NodeFS` at `this.#environment.databaseDataFolder`, loads the `vector` and `live` PGlite extensions, runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`, defensively drops stale `live_query_%` views/tables/prepared-statements left over from unclean shutdowns (`index.ts:62-114` — a real operational scar, not theoretical), then builds a `drizzle(driver, { schema })` client and calls Drizzle's own `migrate()` against a `databaseMigrationsFolder` of SQL migration files (generated via `drizzle-kit generate`, `package.json:26`, output under `drizzle/migrations`). This is a schema-versioned, tool-generated migration pipeline — the opposite of the legacy file's manual `ALTER TABLE` checks.
- **The new schema already covers knowledge/RAG and MCP servers, not yet chat.** `src/main/database/schema/tables.ts` defines `collection`, `document`, `documentChunk` (with an HNSW index over a 1024-dim `vector` column, `tables.ts:198,220` — `bge-m3` embedding dimensionality, matching the README's local-embedding claim), `conversationCollection`, `prompt`, `project`, `conversation`, `turn`, `provider`, `usage`, and `server` (the MCP server table). Conspicuously, `tables.ts:570-573` has **commented-out** `bookmarkColumns`/`bookmark` table stubs — direct evidence bookmarks are slated to move but haven't yet.
- **`legacyId` is the migration's join key, and `onConflictDoNothing` makes re-runs idempotent.** Every migrated table (`collection`, `document`, `documentChunk`) carries a `legacyId: varchar(...)` column with a `uniqueIndex().on(table.legacyId).where(isNotNull(...))` (`tables.ts:91,167,223`). `LegacyDataMigrator` (`src/main/services/legacy-data-migrator.ts`) uses this for a five-stage, order-dependent migration — `#migrateCollections` → `#migrateDocuments` → `#migrateDocumentChunks` → `#migrateTransitionalChatCollections` → `#migrateServersConfig` (`legacy-data-migrator.ts:41-433`), each guarded by a `this.state.migrated.<name>` flag persisted via `Stateful.Persistable` so a completed stage is skipped on next launch (`legacy-data-migrator.ts:46-48,85-90`). Document-chunk vectors are pulled not from SQLite but from a **third store**, a legacy LanceDB table (`context.legacyLanceDB.openTable("knowledge")`, `legacy-data-migrator.ts:202-291`) — so the pre-migration app actually spanned three storage engines (SQLite for structured data, LanceDB for vectors, a JSON servers-config file) before consolidating toward PGlite+pgvector.
- **Chats, messages, and bookmarks are the visible gap.** `LegacyDataMigrator.State["migrated"]` (`legacy-data-migrator.ts:518-526`) only tracks `"collections" | "documents" | "documentChunks" | "transitionChatCollections" | "serversConfig"` — there is no `messages` or `bookmarks` key. Combined with `useBookmarkStore.ts` and `SearchDialog.tsx` both still calling `window.electron.db.*` (the legacy IPC verbs, not a Drizzle/PGlite path), this is direct proof the conversation-history domain has not crossed over yet, even though the underlying infrastructure (PGlite, migrator, `legacyId` pattern) is already built and working for other domains.

## Full-text search — two call sites, same technique, no FTS engine

- **Global search across all chats** (`src/renderer/components/SearchDialog.tsx:109-146`) splits the query on whitespace into `keywords`, builds one `(prompt like ? OR reply like ?)` clause per keyword ANDed together, wraps each keyword in `%...%`, and runs it via `window.electron.db.all(sql, params)` against the legacy `messages` table — `SELECT id, chatId, prompt, reply FROM messages WHERE ... ORDER BY messages.createdAt ASC LIMIT 10`. Matched snippets are then extracted client-side by `extractMatchedSnippet()` (`SearchDialog.tsx:32-87`), which does its own substring-index math to build a highlighted window around each hit and merges overlapping windows — a hand-built excerpt/highlight system operating on the raw strings, not on any search-engine-provided ranking or offsets.
- **Bookmark search** (`src/stores/useBookmarkStore.ts:162-194`, `fetchBookmarks`) is the same pattern applied to a single combined keyword string rather than tokenized keywords: `(prompt like ? or reply like ? or memo like ?)` with one `%keyword%` parameter reused three times, ANDed with an optional `favorite = ?` filter, `ORDER BY createdAt DESC`.
- **No SQLite FTS5 virtual table, no Postgres `tsvector`/`to_tsquery`, no ranking function anywhere in `src/main` or `src/renderer`.** Both search paths are `LIKE`-based substring scans against un-indexed text columns (the `messages`/`bookmarks` table definitions in `sqlite.ts` have no `index`/virtual-table statements for `prompt`/`reply`/`memo`) — correctness-first, not scale-first. This is consistent with 5ire's position as a single-user local desktop app rather than a searchable-at-scale knowledge base; the newer PGlite side does get proper indexing (`tables.ts` has `index()`/`uniqueIndex()` calls throughout), just not yet for conversation text.

## Bookmarks — a durable snapshot decoupled from the source message

- **Bookmarks copy content rather than reference it live.** The legacy `bookmarks` table (`src/main/sqlite.ts:88-109`) stores its own `prompt`, `reply`, `reasoning`, `temperature`, `model`, `memo`, `citedFiles`, `citedChunks` columns — a full snapshot of the turn, not a foreign key alone — with a `UNIQUE ("msgId")` constraint (`sqlite.ts:105`) that still ties it back to the originating message for de-duplication (one bookmark per message) while remaining independently readable. The README states this design intent directly: "You can bookmark each conversation, and even if the original messages are deleted, the saved bookmarked content remains unaffected" (`README.md`, Bookmarks section).
- **Bookmark store is a thin Zustand wrapper over the same raw-SQL IPC bridge as search.** `useBookmarkStore.ts` builds `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` SQL by hand from whichever fields are present (`createBookmark`, `updateBookmark`, `sqlite.ts:58-131` — note the `?`.repeat(columns.length) placeholder-generation idiom at `useBookmarkStore.ts:67`), with client-side state (`bookmarks`, `favorites` arrays) kept in sync manually after each mutation rather than via any live-query mechanism — a contrast with the new PGlite `MCPServersManager`/`MCPConnectionsManager`, which get automatic UI updates for free from `driver.live.query`/`driver.live.changes`.
- **Favorites are just a `favorite` boolean column on the same table**, not a separate collection — `loadFavorites()` calls the same `fetchBookmarks({ favorite: true })` path (`useBookmarkStore.ts:200-208`).

## MCP client — SDK-native transports, DB-driven reconnection, and a community marketplace

- **Two real transports, chosen by a `transport` enum column, not string-sniffing a URL.** `serverTransport = pgEnum(..., ["stdio", "http-streamable"])` (`tables.ts:579`) and `MCPConnectionsManager.#transport()` (`mcp-connections-manager.ts:72-97`) builds either a `StdioClientTransport` (parsing `endpoint` as a shell command line via `parseCommandLine`, passing `config` as env vars) or a `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` (treating `endpoint` as a URL, `config` as headers) — explicitly noting in a comment that `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` now subsumes what used to require a separate SSE transport (`mcp-connections-manager.ts:94-96`).
- **Connection lifecycle is a real state machine with retry, abort, and error surfacing**, not fire-and-forget. `#connect()` (`mcp-connections-manager.ts:104-204`) retries up to 3 times with a linearly increasing delay (`1000 * retries` ms), threads an `AbortController` through so a server removed mid-connect cleans up correctly, and lands in one of three states — `connecting | connected | error` — each carrying the data relevant to that state (`Connection` union type, `mcp-connections-manager.ts:367-421`). `getConnectedOrThrow()` (`mcp-connections-manager.ts:328-348`) gives callers actionable per-state error messages rather than a generic null-check.
- **Server config changes reconnect automatically via the database's live-query changefeed — the clearest example in this study of persistence and MCP-connection-management being unified through one reactive primitive.** `init()` (`mcp-connections-manager.ts:244-321`) runs a Drizzle query for active servers, then wraps it in `driver.live.changes(...)` (PGlite's live-query extension) keyed by `id`; on every emitted change it diffs `__changed_columns__`, decides whether the effective server snapshot actually differs (`isEqual`), and disconnects+reconnects only when it does. Toggling a server's `active` flag or editing its `endpoint`/`config` from the UI needs no explicit "apply" step in the connections manager — it's driven entirely by the DB emitting a row change.
- **Short numeric IDs exist purely for LLM-facing tool-call ergonomics.** `MCPServersManager` maintains a `shortIds: Map<string, number>` (`mcp-servers-manager.ts:402-411`) assigning small monotonic integers to each UUID server ID as servers are created — presumably so tool-call URIs or prompts shown to a model don't need to carry full UUIDs (`getShortId`/`getIdFromShortId`, `mcp-servers-manager.ts:302-323`).
- **Tools are addressed by a custom URI scheme layering connection + tool name.** `MCPToolsManager.#formatToolURI()` builds `tool:${connectionId}/${encodeURIComponent(tool.name)}` (`mcp-tools-manager.ts:30-32`), with a matching `#parseToolURI` — giving every tool call a single string identifier that round-trips back to both which server and which tool, capped at `MAX_TOOLS_PAGE = 10` pages of pagination per server (`mcp-tools-manager.ts:15`).
- **The marketplace is an external static JSON feed, not an in-app registry.** `useMCPServerMarketStore.fetchServers()` (`src/stores/useMCPServerMarketStore.ts:22-43`) fetches `https://mcpsvr.com/servers.json` directly from the renderer process (a plain `fetch`, no IPC involved), caches the result plus an `updatedAt` timestamp in Zustand state with a `REMOTE_CONFIG_TTL` of `1000 * 60 * 60 * 24` (24 hours), and only re-fetches when `force` is passed or the cache has expired. `ToolMarketDrawer.tsx` (`src/renderer/pages/tool/MarketDrawer.tsx:36-63`) does client-side filtering across `name`/`description` against space-split search terms, and its "Submit" button (`MarketDrawer.tsx:93-98`) links out to `https://github.com/nanbingxyz/mcpsvr` — the marketplace's own repo — for community members to add their server. `onInstall` (wired at `src/renderer/pages/tool/index.tsx:149`) ultimately calls the same `createServer` path as manual configuration, writing a new row into the shared `servers` table that `MCPConnectionsManager` is already watching — so "install from marketplace" and "hand-configure a server" are the exact same code path downstream of the drawer.

## What's inside this submodule

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `src/main/sqlite.ts` | Legacy `better-sqlite3` store — table DDL, `ALTER TABLE`-based ad hoc migrations, the 4-verb raw-SQL IPC bridge (`db-all`/`db-run`/`db-transaction`/`db-get`) |

If you read three files: `src/main/services/legacy-data-migrator.ts` (the migration's actual shape and its gaps), `src/main/services/mcp-connections-manager.ts` (the cleanest MCP-client + live-query integration in this study), and `src/main/database/schema/tables.ts` (what has and hasn't crossed over — the commented-out `bookmark` stub is the tell).

## Mental model for using it well

- **Treat 5ire as two codebases occupying one repo.** Anything touching knowledge/RAG, providers, or MCP servers is on the modern PGlite+Drizzle+live-query stack; anything touching chats, messages, bookmarks, or search is still on raw-SQL SQLite reached through a stringly-typed IPC bridge. Don't assume a pattern found in one domain (e.g., live-query reactivity) applies to the other yet.
- **`legacyId` + `onConflictDoNothing` is the reusable migration idiom worth lifting.** A nullable, uniquely-indexed `legacyId` column on the new table lets a migration re-run safely and be resumed/interrupted without duplicate rows — cleaner than a one-shot "big bang" migration script.
- **MCP server config-as-database-row, watched via live query, is the reusable MCP-host idiom.** Rather than an explicit "reconnect" action, treat server activation/config edits as ordinary row mutations and let a `driver.live.changes` subscriber own the connect/disconnect side effects — this collapses "server management UI" and "connection manager" into one reactive pipeline.
- **The marketplace is intentionally dumb — a static JSON feed plus client-side filtering — and that's the point.** No backend, no server-side search index, no submission workflow inside the app; new entries land via PRs to a separate `mcpsvr` repo. Don't over-build a marketplace surface if a static feed with a TTL cache covers the actual need.
- **Read the license before treating anything here as a drop-in dependency.** The "Modified Apache-2.0" terms gate commercial redistribution and enterprise use — this is reference material for architecture, not a library to vendor.

## When NOT to reach for this

- **You want a single, finished persistence architecture to copy wholesale.** 5ire's database layer is mid-migration by its own admission (the migrator's incomplete `migrated` state, the commented-out `bookmark` table) — copy the *migration technique*, not the current end-state, unless you specifically want the two-tier legacy+modern split as a template for your own gradual migration.
- **You need FTS-quality conversation search out of the box.** Both search surfaces (`SearchDialog.tsx`, `useBookmarkStore.ts`) are `LIKE`-scan implementations with hand-rolled highlighting — adequate for a single user's local chat history, not a pattern to scale past that.
- **You need a permissive-license reference implementation to fork freely.** The Modified Apache-2.0 terms impose real constraints (brand use, enterprise-scale commercial licensing) that MIT-licensed siblings in this study (e.g. Kaas) don't have.
- **You want a Tauri-shell reference or a dual-shell (Tauri+Electron) comparison.** 5ire is Electron-only via the `.erb` scaffold; for shell-strategy comparisons, look to `dive` (Tauri+Electron dual) instead.

## How this compares to the rest of the study

| Axis | 5ire | dive | anything-llm |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shell** | Electron (`.erb` scaffold) only | Tauri **and** Electron (dual shell) | Electron only |
| **License** | Modified Apache-2.0 (source-available, commercial-use carve-outs) | (see `Profile__Dive.md`) | (see `Profile__Anything-Llm.md`) |
| **Persistence** | Two-tier: legacy `better-sqlite3` (chats/messages/bookmarks, raw-SQL IPC) + new PGlite/Drizzle/pgvector (knowledge, providers, MCP servers), migration in progress via `legacyId`-keyed idempotent copier | (see `Profile__Dive.md`) — MCP-host comparison point | (see `Profile__Anything-Llm.md`) — workspace-switching comparison point |
| **Full-text search** | Hand-rolled `LIKE '%term%'` scans over SQLite `messages`/`bookmarks`, client-side snippet highlighting; no FTS5/tsvector | — | — |
| **Bookmarks** | Full-content snapshot per message (survives source-message deletion), `UNIQUE(msgId)`, favorite-as-boolean-column, no live-query sync | — | — |
| **MCP client** | SDK-native (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`), stdio + streamable-HTTP transports, retry/abort state machine, **live-query-driven auto-reconnect on server-row change** | MCP host (dual-shell) — see sibling profile | — |
| **MCP marketplace** | External static JSON feed (`mcpsvr.com/servers.json`, own community repo), 24h client-side TTL cache, install path converges on manual-config `createServer` | — | — |
| **Reactive UI wiring** | PGlite's `live.query`/`live.changes` extension powers server-list and connection-state UI automatically; legacy-domain stores (bookmarks) still update state manually after each mutation | — | — |
| **Best fit** | Studying a live SQLite→Postgres(WASM) migration in a shipping desktop app, and/or the most complete MCP-client+marketplace pairing in this study | Cross-shell (Tauri/Electron) MCP-host comparison | Workspace-switching UX comparison |

5ire's load-bearing contribution to this study is **a real, in-progress persistence migration (SQLite/LanceDB → PGlite/pgvector) caught mid-flight in the source tree, paired with the study's most complete MCP-client implementation — SDK-native transports, a retry/abort connection state machine, and reconnection driven entirely by the new database's live-query changefeed — plus a working, minimal community marketplace (a static JSON feed with a TTL cache) that any MCP-client-building project could copy almost verbatim.**

## One-line summary

> 5ire is an Electron desktop MCP client caught mid-migration between two persistence stacks — a legacy `better-sqlite3` file serving chats, messages, and bookmarks through a raw-SQL IPC bridge with `LIKE`-scan search, and a newer PGlite/Drizzle/pgvector database that already owns knowledge-base RAG and MCP server config, copied over by an idempotent `legacyId`-keyed migrator that hasn't yet reached conversation history — while its MCP-client layer is the study's most complete: SDK-native stdio/streamable-HTTP transports, a retry-and-abort connection state machine, reconnection driven automatically by the database's own live-query changefeed, and a real community marketplace (a static `mcpsvr.com/servers.json` feed, 24-hour cached) whose "install" button writes into the very same `servers` table the connection manager is already watching.
