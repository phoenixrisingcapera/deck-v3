lede: One real OS child process per workspace — but only ever one binary. What varies
  per workspace is the invocation, not the backend.
summary: 'Source-cited profile of the Open Vibe submodule for the conversational-UI-and-native-shells
  study, written to adjudicate a specific claim in the research summary. Verdict:
  the "one `codex app-server` process per workspace over JSON-RPC/stdio" claim is
  fully confirmed in source, but calling it a process-level adapter swap overstates
  it — there is exactly one adapter. The profile separates the two axes an agent is
  likely to conflate: real process isolation and per-workspace config inheritance
  (both present, cleanly done, worktree-to-parent fallback chains for `CODEX_HOME`
  and CLI args) versus swappable backend identity (absent — no provider enum, no second
  agent CLI). Also documents two things easily misread: the `remote_backend` module,
  a mutually exclusive single-TCP-connection transport that collapses the per-workspace
  model entirely when active, and the nanobot `LLMProvider` trait, which belongs to
  the chat-bridge feature and is not a coding-agent adapter. Note the maturity caveat
  — single-contributor, no ADRs, no architecture doc, so every claim here comes from
  source rather than a maintained decision log. Positions between `Profile__Routa.md`
  (positive result) and `Profile__Dive.md` (one shared subprocess).'

# Open Vibe — Profile

A profile of Open Vibe as it lives in this study (`studies/conversational-ui-and-native-shells/open-vibe/`). `LICENSE:1-3` confirms MIT, "Copyright (c) 2026 Thomas Ricouard / Copyright (c) 2026 citizenl". Read alongside `Profile__Routa.md` (genuine per-session ACP process spawn, provider chosen per call) and `Profile__Dive.md` (one shared Python subprocess for the whole app) — **Open Vibe sits between them: it genuinely spawns one real OS child process per workspace, with real per-workspace argv/env/cwd scoping, but the thing being spawned is always the same single binary (`codex`) — there is no adapter registry, no provider parameter, no swappable backend. It is a process-per-workspace supervisor around exactly one CLI, not a process-level adapter swap.**

## TL;DR

The repo's own README says it plainly at `README.md:35`: "Start one `codex app-server` per workspace; list/resume/archive threads." That is not marketing rounding — it is exactly what the code does. `spawn_workspace_session` (`src-tauri/src/backend/app_server.rs:290-464`) builds a `tokio::process::Command`, sets `command.current_dir(&entry.path)` (line 307), appends the literal argument `command.arg("app-server")` (line 308), sets `CODEX_HOME` from a per-workspace resolver if present (lines 309-311), and pipes stdin/stdout/stderr (lines 312-314) before `command.spawn()` (line 316). The resulting `WorkspaceSession` (`app_server.rs:60-68`) holds the live `Child`, its `ChildStdin`, and a `pending: HashMap<u64, oneshot::Sender<Value>>` for in-flight JSON-RPC-shaped requests keyed by an auto-incrementing `next_id` — a real line-delimited JSON-RPC-over-stdio protocol, confirmed by `send_request`/`send_notification`/`send_response` (`app_server.rs:81-106`) and the `"initialize"`/`"initialized"` handshake at lines 428-452.

Workspace scoping is real, not a config-row convenience: `connect_workspace_inner` (`src-tauri/src/workspaces/commands.rs:1471-1520`) looks up the `WorkspaceEntry` by `id`, resolves that workspace's own `codex_bin`, `codex_args` (`resolve_workspace_codex_args`, `commands.rs`, worktree-inherits-from-parent then falls back to global app settings), and `codex_home` (`resolve_workspace_codex_home`, `codex_home.rs:6-35`, same inheritance chain plus a legacy `.codexmonitor` directory fallback), then spawns a session and inserts it into `state.sessions: Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<WorkspaceSession>>>` (`state.rs:15`) keyed by workspace id. If a session already exists for that id and `force_respawn` isn't set, `connect_workspace_inner` short-circuits and returns the existing one (`commands.rs:1477-1481`); if a stale session is being replaced, the old child process is explicitly killed (`commands.rs:1515-1518`). A dedicated `GLOBAL_WORKSPACE_ID = "__global__"` session exists for cross-workspace operations like listing all threads (`codex.rs:31, 154-201, 415-449`).

**Verdict on the research summary's claim:** the "one `codex app-server` process per workspace over JSON-RPC/stdio" claim is **fully confirmed and independently verified** in `app_server.rs` and `workspaces/commands.rs` — this part is real, not shallow. But calling this a "genuine process-level adapter swap" (in the sense Routa's `AcpManager` earns that label) overstates it: **there is only one adapter.** `build_codex_command_with_bin` (`app_server.rs:173-196`) always resolves to a binary literally named `codex` unless the user points `codex_bin` at a differently-named executable on disk — there is no `provider` parameter, no registry of alternative coding-agent CLIs (no Claude Code SDK, OpenCode, or Gemini CLI adapter anywhere in `src-tauri/src/`), and no protocol-normalization layer comparable to Routa's ACP. What *is* swappable per-workspace is argv (`codex_args`), environment (`CODEX_HOME`), and cwd (`entry.path`) for the same binary — configuration-of-invocation, not adapter identity.

## The workspace-to-process mapping — confirmed, with worktree inheritance

- **One `HashMap` entry, one live child, keyed by workspace id.** `AppState.sessions` (`state.rs:15`) is `Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<crate::codex::WorkspaceSession>>>` — structurally identical in shape to what a "per-workspace process registry" should look like, and every read site (`workspaces/commands.rs:125,135-136,271,332,468,584,708,733,776,916-955,1254-1449`) treats `contains_key`/`get`/`remove` on this map as the connectivity source of truth for a given workspace id.
- **Worktrees are a distinct `WorkspaceKind` that inherit config from their parent, not siblings that get their own default.** `WorkspaceKind::{Main, Worktree, Nanobot}` (`types.rs:223-227`); `resolve_workspace_codex_home` (`codex_home.rs:6-35`) checks the worktree's own override first, then falls back to `parent_entry.settings.codex_home`, then a legacy `parent.path/.codexmonitor` directory, then the global `CODEX_HOME`/`~/.codex` default — proven by three passing unit tests at `codex_home.rs:222-249` (`worktree_inherits_parent_codex_home_override`, `worktree_relative_override_uses_parent_path`). `resolve_workspace_codex_args` (`workspaces/commands.rs`, mirrored logic) does the same for CLI args.
- **A `Nanobot` workspace kind exists as a third case** (`types.rs:226,240-242`, `is_nanobot()`) — evidence the workspace concept is reused for the DingTalk/QQ bot bridge, not solely for git-backed coding workspaces; this is a routing distinction inside the same `sessions` map, not a different process-spawn mechanism.
- **A remote-backend escape hatch exists that is explicitly *not* process-per-workspace.** `remote_backend.rs:53-63` (`RemoteBackend`/`RemoteBackendInner`) opens one `TcpStream` to `127.0.0.1:4732` (`DEFAULT_REMOTE_HOST`, line 14) and multiplexes all calls (`RemoteBackend::call`, lines 65-80) through one connection with its own `pending` map — every workspace command checks `remote_backend::is_remote_mode(&state)` first (e.g. `codex.rs:158,337,365,393,419`) and if remote mode is active, routes through this **one shared TCP connection** instead of spawning anything locally. This is the repo's own version of Dive's "one shared subprocess" pattern, coexisting with the per-workspace-process pattern as an alternate transport, not a fallback within it.

## The CLI-invocation layer — one binary, real path/env resolution, zero adapter registry

- **`build_codex_command_with_bin`** (`app_server.rs:173-196`) resolves `codex_bin` (per-workspace override, falling back to a global default, falling back to the literal string `"codex"`), normalizes Windows path quoting, and decides whether to shell out via `cmd /C` for `.cmd`/`.bat` scripts (`should_run_via_cmd_on_windows`, lines 221-238) — genuine cross-platform invocation hardening, but always for the same logical program.
- **`build_codex_path_env`** (`app_server.rs:109-171`) constructs a synthetic `PATH` by unioning the inherited environment `PATH` with platform-specific extra search locations (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.local/share/mise/shims`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, every `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`, or `%APPDATA%\npm` / `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows) plus the parent directory of an explicit `codex_bin` override — solving the "GUI apps don't inherit shell rc-file PATH" problem that Tauri/Electron apps chronically hit, not multi-provider routing.
- **`check_codex_installation`** (`app_server.rs:240-288`) runs `codex --version` with a 5-second timeout before ever spawning `app-server`, surfacing "Codex CLI not found" / "Codex CLI failed to start" errors with actionable remediation text — defensive plumbing around one CLI's presence, not a provider-selection decision point.
- **No adapter registry, no provider enum, anywhere searched.** `grep` across `src-tauri/src/*.rs` for `claude-code`, `opencode`, `gemini-cli`, `amp`, or any second agent-CLI binary name returns nothing; the only other "provider" concept in the codebase is `nanobot`'s `LLMProvider` trait (`nanobot_bridge_daemon.rs:12,68,124`) — that's the messaging-bot layer (DingTalk/QQ) picking an LLM to answer *bridge* chat, wired to the *same already-running* codex session via a request/response bridge (`OpenVibeProvider`, lines 68-124), not a second coding-agent backend competing with codex for workspace sessions.

## What's inside this submodule

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Plain-language confirmation of the per-workspace `codex app-server` model (`README.md:35`); nanobot/DingTalk bridge, Happy mobile relay |
| `src-tauri/src/backend/app_server.rs` | The actual spawn path — `spawn_workspace_session`, `WorkspaceSession`, `build_codex_command_with_bin`, `build_codex_path_env`, `check_codex_installation` |
| `src-tauri/src/codex.rs` | Tauri commands wrapping the JSON-RPC session (`start_thread`, `resume_thread`, `list_threads`, `list_threads_global`), `ensure_global_session`, `GLOBAL_WORKSPACE_ID` |
| `src-tauri/src/state.rs` | `AppState` — `sessions: Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<WorkspaceSession>>>`, `global_session: OnceCell<...>`, plus dictation/happy/nanobot bridge state |
| `src-tauri/src/workspaces/commands.rs` | `connect_workspace_inner`/`connect_workspace`/`reconnect_workspace`, `resolve_workspace_codex_args`, all `sessions` map read/write sites (1806 lines, largest file in the crate) |
| `src-tauri/src/codex_home.rs` | `resolve_workspace_codex_home` — per-workspace/per-worktree `CODEX_HOME` resolution with tilde/env-var expansion, unit-tested |
| `src-tauri/src/codex_args.rs` | `parse_codex_args`/`apply_codex_args`/`resolve_workspace_codex_args` — per-workspace CLI argument resolution |
| `src-tauri/src/remote_backend.rs` | `RemoteBackend` — alternate single-TCP-connection transport, bypasses local process-per-workspace spawning entirely when active |
| `src-tauri/src/workspaces/worktree.rs`, `git.rs` | Worktree creation/teardown and git plumbing backing the `WorkspaceKind::Worktree` case |
| `src-tauri/src/nanobot_bridge.rs`, `nanobot_bridge_daemon.rs`, `nanobot_integration.rs` | DingTalk/QQ bot bridge — `OpenVibeProvider: LLMProvider`, routes bridge chat into an existing codex session; unrelated to backend/adapter selection |
| `src-tauri/src/happy_bridge.rs` | Mobile relay bridge (Happy) — another consumer of an existing `WorkspaceSession`, not a new spawn path |
| `src-tauri/src/types.rs` | `WorkspaceEntry`, `WorkspaceKind::{Main, Worktree, Nanobot}`, `WorkspaceSettings` (`codexHome`, `codexArgs`, `launchScript`, `worktreeSetupScript`) |
| `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | `tauri = "2"`, `tokio` (process/net/io features), lib name `codex_monitor_lib` — the app's prior name (CodexMonitor) still visible in the crate identifier |
| `src/features/**` | React 19 frontend feature folders (threads, composer, workspaces, git, terminal, dictation, nanobot, happy) — no ADR/architecture docs directory exists in this repo |

If you read two files: `src-tauri/src/backend/app_server.rs` (the actual spawn mechanism — `spawn_workspace_session`, `WorkspaceSession`, the JSON-RPC framing) and `src-tauri/src/workspaces/commands.rs` (`connect_workspace_inner` — proof the spawn is keyed and deduplicated by workspace id, with worktree inheritance for config).

## Mental model for using it well

- **Read "workspace" here as "one codex app-server process," full stop** — there is no session-within-workspace subdivision the way Routa has `AcpManager::create_session` spawning multiple independently-provider-selectable sessions per workspace. Open Vibe's unit of process isolation and its unit of user-facing workspace addressing are the same thing.
- **The swappable axis is invocation, not backend identity.** `codex_bin`, `codex_args`, `codex_home` all resolve per-workspace with worktree-to-parent inheritance — genuinely useful for pointing different workspaces at different Codex CLI versions, config homes, or extra flags — but every one of those workspaces still runs the same underlying agent (Codex). There is no code path where workspace A runs Codex and workspace B runs a different coding agent.
- **Treat the `remote_backend` module as a second, mutually-exclusive transport mode**, not a fallback layered under the per-workspace-process model — when active, it collapses everything to one shared TCP connection, structurally closer to Dive's single-subprocess pattern than to its own default local mode.
- **Don't confuse `nanobot`'s `LLMProvider` trait with a coding-agent adapter.** It's scoped to the DingTalk/QQ chat-bridge feature answering bridge messages through an already-running codex session — a different "provider" axis (which LLM answers bridge chat) layered on top of, not instead of, the one codex process per workspace.
- **No ADRs, no `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** exist in this repo — unlike Routa, there is no maintained decision log; everything above is read directly from source, and the "why" for design choices (e.g., why `remote_backend` exists) is not documented anywhere found in this checkout.

## When NOT to reach for this

- **You want evidence of genuine multi-backend/multi-provider adapter swapping.** Open Vibe has exactly one coding-agent CLI wired in (`codex`). For that question, Routa (`AcpManager::create_session`, provider chosen per session call) is the study's positive result; Open Vibe is neither a positive nor really a comparable negative — it's a different question (process-per-workspace supervision) answered well, for one backend.
- **You want a maintained decision log or architecture document.** There is no `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/adr/` here — reasoning has to be reconstructed from source and the README alone.
- **You're evaluating production maturity or community adoption.** `git shortlog` shows 118 of 119 commits from a single author (`citizenl`) at this pin, with no ADRs, no CONTRIBUTING doc found, and one co-credited license holder who does not otherwise appear in the commit log — this is a solo hobby-scale desktop app, not a broadly-adopted or heavily-reviewed project. Treat every architectural claim here as read directly from working code, not validated by a maintainer team or community usage at scale.
- **You need per-workspace *concurrent, differently-configured* sessions** (multiple simultaneous threads against the same workspace with different models/configs). The `sessions` map is one entry per workspace id — reconnecting or force-respawning replaces the old process outright (`commands.rs:1508-1518`) rather than layering a second concurrent session alongside it.

## How this compares to the rest of the study

| Axis | Open Vibe | routa | dive |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shells/surfaces** | Tauri 2 desktop only, single React 19 frontend | Tauri 2 desktop + Next.js web + VS Code extension, one `api-contract.yaml` | Tauri **and** Electron (dual, same React frontend) |
| **Backend language(s)** | Rust/Tokio (`codex_monitor_lib`), one implementation | Rust/Axum (desktop) **and** TypeScript/Next.js (web) — two independent implementations of one contract | Rust/TS shell + separate Python `dive_httpd` subprocess (submodule) |
| **"Workspace" scope** | Real: `WorkspaceEntry` keyed 1:1 to a live child process in `state.sessions`; worktrees inherit `codex_home`/`codex_args` from parent | Real schema-level scope for sessions, codebases, worktrees, tasks (`workspace_id NOT NULL` FKs); `"default"` explicitly flagged as transition scaffolding | N/A — no workspace concept, one MCP host process for the whole app |
| **Adapter/backend swap unit** | None — one CLI (`codex`) always; only argv/env/cwd vary per workspace via `codex_bin`/`codex_args`/`codex_home` | Per-**session** ACP process spawn (`AcpManager::create_session`) — provider/model/MCP-config chosen per call | One shared Python subprocess (`dive_httpd`) for the whole app — no per-context swap at all |
| **Isolation mechanism** | Real OS child process per workspace (`WorkspaceSession.child`), JSON-RPC-over-stdio, killed and replaced on reconnect | Real OS child process per session (`ManagedProcess`), workspace+session-scoped MCP endpoint URL | None — all tools/providers/conversations flow through the one `dive_httpd` process |
| **Alternate transport** | `remote_backend.rs` — one shared TCP connection, mutually exclusive with local per-workspace spawning | N/A in this checkout | N/A — Python subprocess is the only transport |
| **Docs/decision trail** | None found (no ADRs, no architecture doc); README is the only prose source | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + 6 ADRs, actively maintained | Not profiled here in depth |
| **Maturity/adoption** | Single-contributor (118/119 commits), no CI beyond one bot commit, no CONTRIBUTING doc found — hobby-scale | Larger, more heavily tooled (fitness gates, `.agents/skills/`, CI parity tests) | Separate maturity profile |
| **Best fit** | Reference for "process-per-workspace supervision done cleanly around one CLI, with real per-workspace config/env/cwd resolution" — a genuine but narrower positive result than Routa's | Reference for "genuine per-session/per-workspace adapter and process isolation across a protocol-rich, dual-backend product" — the study's strongest positive result for adapter swapping specifically | Reference for "shell as thin process supervisor around one shared backend" — a different negative result (no per-context swap at all) |

Open Vibe's load-bearing contribution to this study is a **partial positive result, scoped narrowly**: it proves that a Tauri desktop shell can cleanly spawn and supervise one real OS child process per workspace, with genuine per-workspace configuration inheritance (worktree-to-parent fallback chains for both `CODEX_HOME` and CLI args) — but it answers "is the process boundary real?" (yes) without answering "is the backend itself swappable?" (no; there is exactly one CLI wired in, `codex`). Where Routa demonstrates process isolation *and* backend-identity swapping together, Open Vibe demonstrates process isolation alone, cleanly, at hobby-project scale and with no adjacent decision-log documentation to lean on.

## One-line summary

> Open Vibe is a single-contributor Tauri 2 + Rust/Tokio desktop shell that spawns one genuine `codex app-server` child process per workspace — confirmed directly in `spawn_workspace_session` (`src-tauri/src/backend/app_server.rs:290-464`) and `connect_workspace_inner` (`src-tauri/src/workspaces/commands.rs:1471-1520`), with real per-workspace/per-worktree resolution of `codex_bin`, `codex_args`, and `CODEX_HOME` — but it is a process-per-workspace supervisor around exactly **one** coding-agent CLI, not a process-level adapter swap: there is no provider registry, no second backend, and no per-session multiplicity the way Routa's `AcpManager` has, making it a genuine but narrower positive result than Routa and a clear step up from Dive's single shared subprocess.
