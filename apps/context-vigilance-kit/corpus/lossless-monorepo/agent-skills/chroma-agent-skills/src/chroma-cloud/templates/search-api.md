## Search() API

The Search API provides a fluent, composable interface for building complex queries. It's more expressive than the basic `query` method and supports advanced features like hybrid search with rank fusion.

**Note:** The Search API is only available on Chroma Cloud and is designed to work with Collection Schemas.

The Search() API acts as both query() and get() because the search expression that is being passed in ultimately decides what type of query to issue.

### When to use Search() vs query()

**Use `query()` when:**
- You need simple semantic search
- You want the most straightforward API

**Use `search()` when:**
- You need hybrid search combining dense and sparse indexes
- You want fine-grained control over ranking and filtering
- You're building complex queries with multiple conditions
- You need to select specific fields to return

Note that the Search() class uses a builder pattern, so if you call a method on it, it does not mutate that instance, it returns a copy with that mutation, so it needs re-assignging to the variable that is referencing it.

The `search()` method on a collection is able to take a single Search class instance or an arry of them, so the return value of the `search()` method on a collection is a SearchResult class, which has a `rows()` method, which will give you an array of array of results. So index 0 of the return value of `rows()` will be the array of the first Search class instance results.

### Ranking and Scoring

Ranking expressions score and order results. Lower scores = better matches (distance-based). When `rank` is omitted, results are returned in index/insertion order.

Document inclusion rules when combining multiple `Knn` expressions:
- A document must appear in at least one `Knn`'s top-`limit` results to be scored
- It must also appear in every `Knn` where `default=None` (the default); otherwise it's excluded
- Set a `default` value on a `Knn` to assign a fallback score for documents missing from its results, keeping them in the pool. This is usually what you want when combining multiple `Knn` expressions, otherwise the intersection rule often filters out too many candidates.

Expressions support arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, unary `-`) and math functions (`exp`, `log`, `abs`, `min`, `max`) for combining and transforming scores. Numbers are auto-converted to constants, or use `Val(x)` explicitly. A common pattern is a weighted sum like `Knn(query=q) * 0.7 + Knn(query=q, key="sparse_embedding") * 0.3` — but note this mixes two raw distance spaces, which may have very different scales. For robust hybrid ranking across dense + sparse, prefer RRF (below).

Two limits to keep straight:
- `Knn(limit=N)` — how many candidates that `Knn` scores (default 16). Raise it for better recall at the cost of latency.
- `Search.limit(N)` — how many results are returned after ranking.

For rank fusion (RRF), pass `return_rank=True` (Python) / `returnRank: true` (TypeScript) on each `Knn` so it emits rank positions (0, 1, 2…) instead of raw distances — see the Hybrid Search section below.

### Setup

{{CODE:imports}}

### Filtering with Key (K)

The `Key` class (aliased as `K` for brevity) provides a fluent interface for building filter expressions. Think of it like a query builder for metadata, document content, and IDs.

{{CODE:k}}

### Ranking with Knn

`Knn` (k-nearest neighbors) is how you specify which embeddings to search and how to score results. Each `Knn` finds the nearest neighbors for a given query in a specific index.

The `limit` parameter controls how many candidates each `Knn` considers. A higher limit means more candidates are scored, which can improve recall but increases latency.

{{CODE:knn}}

### Basic search example

Here's a complete example showing the typical flow: create a collection, add documents, and search.

### Hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

Hybrid search combines results from multiple indexes (typically dense + sparse) to get better results than either alone. RRF is a rank fusion algorithm that merges ranked lists without needing score normalization.

**How RRF works:**
1. Each `Knn` produces a ranked list of candidates
2. Documents are scored based on their rank position in each list: `1 / (k + rank)`
3. Scores are weighted and summed across all lists
4. Final results are sorted by combined score

The `k` parameter (default 60) controls how much weight top-ranked documents get relative to lower-ranked ones. Higher `k` values make rankings more uniform.

{{CODE:rrf}}

### Building effective hybrid search

For best results with hybrid search:

1. **Use comparable limits** for each `Knn` so both indexes contribute meaningfully
2. **Weight based on your data**: keyword-heavy content might favor sparse; conceptual content might favor dense
3. **Start with 0.7/0.3 weighting** (dense/sparse) and adjust based on evaluation
4. **Use `returnRank: true`** when combining with RRF, as RRF operates on ranks, not distances

Note that return ranks from RRF are netagive and the value furthest from 0 is the closest to the original query.
