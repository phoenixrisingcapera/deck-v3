## Metadata

Metadata in Chroma is structured key-value data stored alongside each document. You can use metadata to filter records in both `query` and `get`, and the metadata model is the same between local and cloud.

### Imports and boilerplate

{{CODE:imports}}

### Filtering with `where`

The `where` argument filters documents by metadata. With `query`, this reduces the candidate set before similarity search runs. The same filter syntax also works with `get` when you want metadata-based retrieval without similarity ranking.

{{CODE:metadata-filtering}}

### Available filter operators

Chroma supports these operators in `where` clauses:

- **Equality:** `$eq` (default if just a value), `$ne`
- **Comparison:** `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`
- **Set membership:** `$in`, `$nin`
- **Array:** `$contains`, `$not_contains`
- **Logical:** `$and`, `$or`

Filters can be nested and combined for complex queries. Filtering in Chroma is usually better than retrieving a larger result set and post-processing it in application code.

### Storing arrays in metadata

Chroma supports storing arrays of strings, numbers, and booleans in metadata fields. This removes the need for workarounds like comma-separated strings or JSON serialization when one field needs multiple values.

**Rules:**
- All elements in an array must share the same type
- Arrays are stored directly on metadata fields alongside regular scalar values

{{CODE:add-with-arrays}}

### Querying array metadata with `$contains`

Use `$contains` in a `where` filter to find records where an array metadata field includes a specific value.

{{CODE:contains-query}}

### Querying array metadata with `$not_contains`

Use `$not_contains` to exclude records where an array metadata field includes a specific value.

{{CODE:not-contains-query}}

### Combining array and scalar filters

Array filters compose with existing logical operators (`$and`, `$or`) and can be combined with scalar metadata filters in the same query.

{{CODE:combined-filters}}

### Common use cases

- **Multi-label tagging:** Store tags or categories as arrays, then filter with `$contains` to find matching records without joins or separate tables.
- **Access control:** Store allowed roles or groups as an array, then filter by the current user's role at query time.
- **Tenant and source filtering:** Store fields like tenant ID, source system, or document type so retrieval can stay scoped to the relevant subset.
