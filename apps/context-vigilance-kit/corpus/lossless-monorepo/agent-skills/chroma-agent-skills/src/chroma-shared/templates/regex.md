## Regex Filtering in Chroma

Chroma supports regex filtering on document content. This is useful when you need exact pattern matching that semantic search can't provide.

### When to use regex vs semantic search

**Use regex when:**
- Matching exact patterns like email addresses, URLs, or code identifiers
- Finding documents containing specific formats (dates, phone numbers, IDs)
- Filtering by prefixes or suffixes in structured data
- You need deterministic, repeatable matches

**Use semantic search when:**
- Looking for conceptually similar content regardless of exact wording
- The user's query is natural language
- You want to find related content even if it uses different terminology

You can combine both: use regex to narrow results, then rank by semantic similarity.

### Imports and boilerplate

### Basic Regex Filter

Use the `$regex` operator in `where_document` to match document content against a regular expression. The regex follows standard regex syntax.

### Combining regex with metadata filters

Regex filters can be combined with metadata filters using `$and` and `$or` operators. This is powerful for narrowing results by both content patterns and structured metadata. Note however regex can not be used on metadata string values.

### Performance considerations

Regex filtering happens after the initial vector search retrieves candidates. For best performance:
- Keep regex patterns simple when possible
- Use metadata filters to reduce the candidate set before regex matching
- Consider whether a metadata field with pre-extracted values would be faster than runtime regex
