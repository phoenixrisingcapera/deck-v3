## Body

Free-form markdown. Typical contents:
- One-paragraph firm summary (from `og:description` or About page)
- Notable investments / case studies if surfaced during crawl
- Anything the human added during review

## Counts

The skill should append a counts section at the end of the body during ingest, e.g.:

```markdown
## Roster (auto-generated)

- Team members (CP1): 12
- Advisors (CP2): 3
- Portfolio companies (CP3): 47
- Portco CEOs (CP4): 47
