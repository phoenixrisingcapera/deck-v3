lede: What this release does in one attention-grabbing sentence
summary: Optional, agent-facing. What this release is FOR, where it sits in the workflow,
  what it unblocks or supersedes, how pseudomonorepo / context-vigilance logic should
  treat it. Not a longer lede — the lede sells the click and feeds OpenGraph; this
  orients an agent deciding whether to open the file.
