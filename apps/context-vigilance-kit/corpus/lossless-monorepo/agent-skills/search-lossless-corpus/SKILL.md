# Search the Lossless Corpus

The Lossless Group keeps a living corpus of its own decisions, shipped work, prior sessions, and tool-failure history in a **local Chroma database** wired into Claude Code via the `chroma` MCP server. Most questions a user asks about *prior work* can be answered from this corpus rather than training data. **Don't paraphrase from training data when the corpus could answer.**

This skill is the discipline that makes the corpus load-bearing. Without it, Chroma sits there full of high-signal records that nobody queries. With it, every "what did we decide about X" question becomes grounded recall — with citations the user can verify in seconds.

## When to use this skill

Trigger when the user's question takes any of these shapes:

- **Decisions** — *"what did we decide about X"*, *"why did we choose X over Y"*, *"what's our stance on X"*
- **Shipping** — *"when did we ship X"*, *"what shipped in May"*, *"did we already do X"*
- **History** — *"what did we talk about last week"*, *"in a prior session we…"*, *"resume where we left off on X"*
- **Failures** — *"has this errored before"*, *"how did we fix X last time"*, *"when did Bash with git rebase fail"*
- **Location** — *"where did we put the X spec"*, *"which repo's changelog mentions Y"*

Trigger also when the user pastes a question that touches Lossless conventions (changelog format, context-v structure, branch-tier model) — the skill canon may have moved since your training cutoff; the corpus reflects current truth.

## The four collections

The MCP server exposes them via tools named `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents`, `mcp__chroma__chroma_list_collections`, `mcp__chroma__chroma_get_documents`, etc. Each collection is keyed to a different question shape:

| Collection | Granularity | Best for | Key metadata fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context-vigilance-corpus` | Section-level chunks of `context-v/` files | Architecture, specs, plans, conventions, "what do we believe about X" | `source_repo_slug`, `source_path`, `kind`, `chunk_heading`, `fm_title`, `fm_status`, `fm_tags` |
| `lossless-changelog` | Whole changelog entries | "What shipped about X and when", cross-repo | `source_repo_slug`, `source_path`, `fm_date`, `fm_title`, `fm_lede`, `fm_tags` |
| `claude-code-sessions` | One document per message turn | "What did we decide about X", resume context | `session_id`, `project_path`, `turn_role`, `timestamp`, `git_branch` |
| `claude-code-tool-traces` | One document per tool invocation | "When did X tool fail and how did we recover" | `tool_name`, `is_error`, `session_id`, `timestamp`, `git_branch` |

All four live in the same Chroma `PersistentClient` at `/Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/ai-labs/context-vigilance-kit/.chroma/`. They are populated by the kit's `ingest-all.sh` script. **You don't ingest from inside this skill.** That work belongs to context-vigilance-kit.

## The agentic-search loop

When a triggering question arrives, run this loop. Cap at **5 chroma queries total per question** — if the corpus doesn't have the answer in five tries, it doesn't have it; say so explicitly.

### 1. Decompose

Read the user's question and break it into 1-3 sub-queries. Each sub-query should target the **one collection most likely to hold its answer**, not all four. Most questions hit one collection. A few hit two (e.g., "what did we decide about X and when did we ship it" → sessions + changelog).

Avoid the temptation to fan out to all four collections — it wastes the query budget and makes synthesis harder.

### 2. Execute

For each sub-query, call `mcp__chroma__chroma_query_documents` with:

- `collection_name`: the picked collection
- `query_texts`: a *natural-language* phrasing of the sub-query (the embedder is semantic; keyword stuffing helps less than coherent phrasing)
- `n_results`: start with **5**. If results look noisy, widen to 10 for one more try.
- `where`: a metadata filter when it makes the query precise. Examples below.

Common `where` filters that narrow effectively:

```python
# Only changelog entries from the ai-labs repo
{"source_repo_slug": "ai-labs"}

# Only tool errors (debugging memory)
{"is_error": True}

# A specific tool's failures
{"$and": [{"tool_name": "Bash"}, {"is_error": True}]}

# Only sessions from a particular project
{"project_path": "/Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/ai-labs"}

# Only context-v files in a specific kind
{"kind": "spec"}
```

Chroma supports `$and`, `$or`, `$in`, `$nin`, `$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, `$ne` operators in `where`. See [[chroma-local]] for the full operator reference.

### 3. Evaluate

Read the top results returned. Ask:

- **Does this cover the question?** If yes, stop and proceed to synthesis.
- **Is there a gap?** If the results gesture toward the answer but miss a piece, run one more focused query against the gap. Don't re-run the same query — that wastes budget.
- **Are the results stale?** Records carry `ingested_at` and frontmatter dates. If a result references a renamed file or removed convention, prefer to verify against the current code rather than recommending from the record. (See "When the memory lies" below.)

### 4. Synthesize

Combine results into one answer. The user wants the answer, not a search report. Do not dump raw chunks; summarize. But **always cite**, every claim, with:

- The `source_path` or `source_repo_slug` + `source_relative_path`
- The `timestamp` or `fm_date` if available
- A clickable reference the user can open: `file_path:line_number` for code/markdown, `session_id` for prior sessions

Citation template:

> "We decided to use `PersistentClient` for v0 ([ai-labs] `context-v/explorations/ChromaDB-as-Context-Improvement-Across-Everything-Everyone.md`, 2026-05-07). The reasoning was that local PersistentClient survives the four deployment shapes without rewriting the API surface, and ladder-up is decided by collaborator joining, splash live-query, or session-transcript volume — none of which apply yet."

The point of citing is that the user can independently verify, course-correct your reading, or surface staleness. A grounded answer without citations is half-grounded.

## Practical query patterns

The shapes that come up most often:

**"What did we decide about X."** → query `claude-code-sessions` with the topic. Filter `where={"turn_role": "assistant"}` if the user wants the *answer* shape; leave unfiltered if they want the *discussion* shape.

**"When did we ship X."** → query `lossless-changelog`. Cross-repo by default; add `where={"source_repo_slug": "<repo>"}` only when the user specifies a repo.

**"How did we fix the X failure last time."** → query `claude-code-tool-traces` with `where={"is_error": True}` first to find the failure, then pivot to `claude-code-sessions` with the matching `session_id` to find the recovery turns. This is the 2-hop pattern.

**"What's our convention for X."** → query `context-vigilance-corpus`. The chunked-by-heading shape means a single chunk usually contains the convention statement plus its rationale.

**"Has this been discussed before."** → query `claude-code-sessions` broadly. If you find prior discussion, summarize the conclusion and ask whether the user wants to continue from there or start fresh.

## Where to pivot from a result

Every result carries metadata that points back to where the full context lives. Use it:

- A `context-vigilance-corpus` hit → open the `source_path` to read the full doc.
- A `lossless-changelog` hit → open the entry's source_path; check `git log` if the entry references a commit.
- A `claude-code-sessions` hit → if the user wants the *full* conversation, they can `claude --resume <session_id>` to re-enter it.
- A `claude-code-tool-traces` hit → the `session_id` + `timestamp` locates the surrounding conversation; the trace's `input` and `output` fields are the failure itself.

## When NOT to use this skill

The skill is for grounding answers in prior work. It's the wrong move when:

- **The question is forward-looking.** "How should we build X" is design, not recall. Recall what we decided about adjacent decisions, sure — but don't pretend the corpus has the answer to a question the team hasn't asked itself yet.
- **The corpus is provably empty on the topic.** If five queries return distant results (distance > 1.5 consistently across collections), the corpus genuinely doesn't have it. Say so. Don't manufacture grounding.
- **The question is about the *current* state of the code.** Code is authoritative; the corpus is frozen at ingest time. Read the code. Use the corpus for *intent and history*, the code for *current behavior*.
- **The user explicitly says "don't check memory" / "ignore prior conversations."** Honor the override. Answer fresh.

## When the memory lies

Records are point-in-time snapshots. A spec from March that named file `foo.md` may have been renamed; a changelog entry that announced flag `--bar` may have shipped with `--baz`. Before recommending an action that depends on a corpus result existing today:

- If the result names a file path → verify the file still exists (`ls` / `Read` on it).
- If the result names a function, flag, or command → grep for it in the current code.
- If the user is about to *act* on the recommendation (not just asking about history), verify first.

"The corpus says X exists" is not the same as "X exists now." Recall is a starting point, not a citation.

## Anti-patterns

- **Fanning out to all four collections by default.** Wastes the 5-query budget. Pick the collection that fits the question shape.
- **Re-running the same query with slightly different wording.** If query 1 returned nothing useful, query 2 with the same intent won't either. Re-decompose.
- **Returning raw chunks instead of a synthesized answer.** The user wanted the answer, not the receipts. Cite, don't dump.
- **Treating a high-distance hit as a real answer.** Distances above ~1.3 on the default `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedder usually mean "no real match." Don't manufacture certainty from a soft hit.
- **Querying the corpus for questions the user could answer faster by looking.** "What's in the current branch's diff" is `git diff`, not Chroma.

## Cross-references

- [[context-vigilance]] — what the `context-vigilance-corpus` collection indexes. The shape and rationale of `context-v/`.
- [[changelog-conventions]] — what the `lossless-changelog` collection indexes. The shape and rationale of `<repo>/changelog/`.
- [[pseudomonorepos]] — explains the `source_repo_slug` taxonomy you'll see in metadata across all collections.
- [[Up-and-Running-on-ChromaDB]] (lossless-content `lost-in-public/up-and-running/`) — the narrative of how the corpus came to be; useful when the user asks "why does this exist."

## tl;dr

When the user asks something prior work might know, **run the loop**: decompose into 1-3 sub-queries, hit the right collection, evaluate, synthesize **with citations**. Cap at five queries. Pivot back to source files when the user wants depth. Don't paraphrase training-data when the corpus is right there.
