# Git Conventions

The Lossless Group's conventions for git commit messages — making history readable, searchable, and useful for future-you.

**Status:** Initial scaffold (May 2026) — documenting observed patterns from lossless-monorepo.

## When to use this skill

- Writing commit messages (any repo)
- Reviewing commits before push
- Teaching commit conventions to collaborators
- User asks "how should I format this commit?"
- User mentions "commit message", "git conventions", "effort grouping"

## Core Patterns

### 1. Header Syntax

Two accepted patterns:

**Pattern A: Single effort grouping**
```
{action}({effort-grouping}): {narrative description}
```

**Pattern B: Multiple effort groupings or chained actions**
```
{action}({effort-1}, {effort-2}): {narrative description}
{action}({effort-1}), {action}({effort-2}): {narrative description}
```

**Examples:**
```
feat(theme-system): Add vibrant mode verification checklist
fix(mode-switcher, theme.css): Vibrant mode now dark-based with neon effects
doc(README), skill(astro-knots): Update vibrant mode guidance
```

### 2. Common Action Verbs

| Action | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature, new capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix, correction |
| `doc` | Documentation changes |
| `refactor` | Code restructure without behavior change |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change) |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance, deps, tooling |
| `skill` | Skill file changes (lossless-skills repo) |
| `changelog` | Changelog entry added/updated |

### 3. Effort Groupings

**What is an effort grouping?** The part of the codebase this commit touches — a package, a site, a system, a concern.

**Examples:**
- `skill(theme-system)` — changes to theme-system skill
- `feat(reach-edu-hub)` — new feature in reach-edu-hub site
- `fix(mode-switcher, theme.css)` — bug fix touching both files/systems
- `doc(README, CANDIDATES)` — documentation changes in both files

**Guideline:** Use the most specific grouping that makes sense. If a commit touches multiple unrelated areas, consider splitting into multiple commits.

### 4. Body Structure (The Important Part)

**Rule: Use paragraph spacing to separate concerns. Do not lump.**

**Structure:**

1. **First paragraph: Sense-making summary**  
   Anyone (future-you, a new contributor, a stakeholder) should understand what this commit does and why.

2. **Second paragraph: Impact**  
   What changes does this commit introduce? Focus on **what the changes do**, not how they're implemented.

3. **Third+ paragraphs: Breakdown by concern**  
   Cluster related changes. One paragraph per cluster. Each paragraph explains a cohesive set of changes.

4. **Affected files list**  
   List files changed that align with the header. Makes git log searchable.

5. **"Also included:" section (optional)**  
   Minor changes, formatting tweaks, riders that aren't worth their own commit. Keeps commit history clean.

**Example structure:**
```
fix(mode-switcher, theme.css): Vibrant mode now dark-based with neon effects

Problem: Light and vibrant modes were indistinguishable because vibrant
mode only set effect tokens and inherited light mode's white background.

Solution: Vibrant mode now comprehensively overrides all surface/text/border
tokens. Uses color-mix() for glassmorphic surfaces, multi-color neon gradients
(lime → cyan → blue → violet), and high glow opacity (0.55 vs 0.22 in dark).

CSS changes (theme.css):
- Added named tokens for vibrant palette (cyan-bright, violet-deep, lime-terminal)
- Vibrant mode block now sets background, surface, text, border
- Multi-stop gradient definition for headlines

Mode switcher (mode-switcher.js):
- No changes needed — switcher already supported three modes

Files changed:
- src/styles/global.css
- src/pages/brand-kit/index.astro

Also included:
- Fixed typo in README
- Removed debug console.log from Header.astro
```

### 5. Pre-Commit Checklist: Changelogs & Context-v

**Before you commit, CONSIDER (don't assume) two things:**

#### Should a changelog be written?

**When to write a changelog:**
- At the **conclusion or final stages** of a coherent flow of work
- When implementing a spec or completing a sequence of related prompts
- When something of substance changed that matters to humans, the team, or users

**Frequency expectations:**
- **1 or fewer per day** = meeting expectations
- **Up to 5 per day** on heavy shipping days
- It depends on the coherence of the commit set

**Why this matters:**
- Changelogs are a **trust-reinforcing rhythm**
- They're **breadcrumbs** on progress/decisions/changes of substance
- They're for humans, not machines

**Common mistake:** Rushing to commit without considering if a changelog is needed, then having to make a tiny "oops(changelog): add missing entry" commit or amend+force-push. Causes drag.

#### Do README or context-v files need updating?

**Not a hard rule**, but worth considering:
- Has the project's purpose shifted? Update README.
- Did we make decisions that should be documented? Update `context-v/` files.
- Are specs, blueprints, or prompts now stale? Flag or update them.

**Why this matters:**
- Keeps `context-v/` accurate to current thinking and practice
- Prevents future confusion about why decisions were made
- Reduces "wait, why did we do it this way?" conversations

**Common mistake:** Same as changelogs — rushing to commit, then realizing context is stale, then making an "oops(context-v): update stale spec" commit.

**The discipline:** Pause before `git commit`. Ask:
1. Is this the end of a coherent flow of work? → Consider changelog.
2. Did we make decisions or changes that shift context? → Consider updating `context-v/` or README.

If yes to either, do it **in the same commit** or **before committing**. Don't rush.

### 6. Key Principles

**Sense-making first:** The first paragraph should explain what and why in plain language. Assume the reader knows nothing about the context.

**Impact over implementation:** Explain what changes, not how you changed it. "Vibrant mode now dark-based" (impact) before "Changed --color-surface value" (implementation).

**Paragraph spacing matters:** Blank lines between concerns makes commits scannable. Lumped paragraphs are hard to parse.

**List riders explicitly:** If you're sneaking in unrelated changes (typo fix, debug cleanup), list them under "Also included:" so they don't pollute the main narrative.

**Affected files consistency:** Files listed should match the effort groupings in the header. If the header says `(mode-switcher, theme.css)`, those files should appear in the body.

## Pre-Commit Anti-Patterns

❌ **Rush to commit without considering changelog:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
# Later: "Oh, I should have written a changelog"
# Now: Either make tiny oops commit or amend+force-push
```

✅ **Pause, consider, include if needed:**
```bash
# Write changelog entry if this completes coherent work
vim changelog/2026-05-04_02.md
git add changelog/
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature

See changelog/2026-05-04_02.md for details."
```

❌ **Rush to commit with stale context-v:**
```bash
git commit -m "refactor: change approach"
# Later: "The spec is now wrong"
# Now: Either update separately or amend
```

✅ **Update context-v in same commit:**
```bash
# Update stale spec while making the change
vim context-v/specs/Feature-Spec.md
git add context-v/
git commit -m "refactor: change approach

Updated spec to reflect new implementation strategy."
```

## Common Mistakes (Headers & Bodies)

❌ **Vague headers:**
```
fix: updates
feat: changes to theme
```

✅ **Specific headers:**
```
fix(mode-switcher): Vibrant mode toggle now persists to localStorage
feat(theme-system): Add two-tier token architecture reference
```

❌ **Lumped body:**
```
Fixed vibrant mode and also updated docs and added new tokens and fixed a typo in README and changed the mode switcher and...
```

✅ **Paragraph-spaced body:**
```
Fixed vibrant mode by making it dark-based instead of light-based.

Theme changes:
- Added cyan-bright, violet-deep, lime-terminal named tokens
- Vibrant mode block now sets all surface/text/border tokens

Documentation:
- Updated setup playbook with vibrant verification checklist
- Added examples to quickstart guide

Also included:
- Fixed typo in README
```

## Push-output gotchas

### GitHub's Dependabot banner is unreliable — don't surface it as actionable

When `git push` completes, GitHub may print a `remote:` banner like
`GitHub found N vulnerabilities on <repo>'s default branch`. **Treat this
as noise, not signal.** Observed on lossless-group repos:

- The banner count is computed independently of the Dependabot alerts UI
  and drifts from it; counts stay pinned for weeks after the underlying
  lockfile entries are gone.
- It fires even when Dependabot is **disabled** for the repo.
- Walking through the listed advisories with Claude Code and resolving
  the lockfile entries has not moved the banner count in practice.

**Don't** raise it to the user as a follow-up action on an unrelated push
(e.g. a marketplace-compliance push). If the user is actively working on
dependency hygiene, that's a different conversation.

## Cross-skill ties

- **`changelog-conventions`** — commit messages often become changelog entries
- **`context-vigilance`** — commit message structure mirrors document frontmatter discipline

## Commit messages also serve four audiences

Commit messages surface publicly via the GitHub commits view, via push-time release notes, via the parent pseudomonorepo's rolled-up changelog feed, and via search engines indexing the commit pages. They carry the **same four-audience discipline** that `changelog-conventions` codifies for `README.md`, changelog entries, and release narratives:

1. **General audience** — the header has to land in two seconds (a passer-by reading the repo's commits page should grok what shipped)
2. **Nerds passing by** — the first body paragraph should explain *what* changed and *why* it matters, in human terms (not just a file-diff narration)
3. **Nerds paying close attention** — subsequent paragraphs name specific files, behaviors, edge cases, and any non-obvious decisions
4. **Internal team** — the tail can carry SHAs, Co-Authored-By, ticket numbers, follow-up notes

Same principle as the long-form docs: **sequence the content from broadest to most-specific** so each reader gets dropped at the right station. The pre-commit checklist (§5) and the body-structure conventions (§4) already encode much of this in mechanics; the audience cascade is the framing that makes the *why* legible.

For the full framing (including the "long files are fine if you stamp a TOC" rule that applies to release narratives), see the `changelog-conventions` skill, section **"These are marketing artifacts, not internal documentation"**.

## What's Not Here Yet (TBD)

- [ ] `references/header-patterns.md` — comprehensive action verb + effort grouping catalog
- [ ] `references/body-structure.md` — deep dive on paragraph spacing and impact-first writing
- [ ] `references/examples.md` — 10+ real commit messages from lossless repos annotated
- [ ] `templates/commit-message-template.txt` — boilerplate for git commit.template

## Development Notes

This skill is being extracted from commit history across:
- `lossless-skills` repo
- `astro-knots` monorepo
- Individual site repos (reach-edu-hub, fullstack-vc, etc.)

Observed patterns will be documented incrementally.
