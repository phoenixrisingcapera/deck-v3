# Browser-drive verification — the kit's rollout draft

## The pattern, in one paragraph

UI-bearing work gets a browser-drive rung between scripted E2E and the human
walk-through: the agent wires **Playwright MCP** at project scope
(`claude mcp add -s project playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest`, lands
in the committed `.mcp.json`, loads next session), drives the click-path
named in the phase plan (navigate → click → type → assert on accessibility
snapshots, screenshots only for visual questions), with reads unrestricted
and writes gated to each repo's designated safe target. `claude --chrome`
is the interactive sibling for watch-me-drive sessions. The drive proves
buttons *work*; the human still judges *usable*.

## What the kit adds — rollout machinery (proposed, unbuilt)

1. **A core-MCP registry.** One canonical file in this kit (proposed:
   `scripts/core-mcps.json`) declaring the tree's foundational servers and
   their scope guidance — the same role `sync-skills-symlinks.sh` plays for
   skills. Candidate registry as of 2026-07-22:
   - `playwright` — universal, project scope, every UI-bearing repo
   - `chroma` — universal, already user-scope laptop-wide + project scope at ai-labs
   - `surrealdb` — conditional, project scope where the canonical layer is in play (augment-it precedent: `scripts/mcp-surrealdb.sh`)
2. **An idempotent wiring script.** Proposed `scripts/ensure-core-mcps.sh
   <repo-path>`: merges missing core entries into the target repo's
   `.mcp.json` (create-if-absent, never clobber existing entries, never
   touch non-core entries) and prints what changed. Run as an
   opening-habit sibling to the skills sync.
3. **The traveling CLAUDE.md block.** The canonical instruction block lives
   in the anchor root `CLAUDE.md`; every Lossless-owned repo's `CLAUDE.md`
   carries it verbatim. When the block changes, the kit is where the
   "re-propagate" sweep should live (proposed:
   `scripts/sync-claude-md-blocks.sh`, marker-comment-delimited so the
   sweep is mechanical).
4. **Corpus visibility.** Because this kit's ingest scripts feed the Chroma
   collections, drive scripts and their outcomes (named in plans +
   changelogs per the pattern) become searchable prior art — "has this
   surface been browser-driven before" becomes a `search-lossless-corpus`
   query, for free.

## Open questions (draft status is real)

- [ ] Does the registry belong here or in the anchor root's `context-v/`?
  (Leaning here — the kit is the only repo whose *job* is cross-tree
  operationalization; the root blueprint stays the human-readable spec.)
- [ ] Marker-comment convention for the traveling block
  (`<!-- lossless:core-mcps:start/end -->`?) — needed before any sync
  script can be trusted not to clobber hand-edits.
- [ ] Should `ensure-core-mcps.sh` also verify `npx @playwright/mcp` is
  runnable (node present, network) or stay pure-config?
